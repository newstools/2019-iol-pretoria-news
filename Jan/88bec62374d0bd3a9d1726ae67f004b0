Accompanied by his wife Dr Tshepo Motsepe, his trip includes two working visits - the launch of the commission and attending the World Economic Forum in Davos which started yesterday. From Switzerland he goes to India for a state visit that will encompass global discussions on the future of work, global governance and partnership in an age of rapid technological change. After taking part in discussions at Davos, Ramaphosa embarks on the state visit to the Republic of India where he will attend the Republic Day parade as the chief guest of honour to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In 1995, Nelson Mandela, then president, was afforded this distinct honour. Republic Day commemorates the day in 1930 when the Declaration of Indian Independence (Purna Swaraj) was proclaimed as well as the day the constitution was enforced in 1950 following Indiaâ€™s independence from Britain in 1947. India and South Africa have strong bilateral relations which have grown since 1994. Both are Commonwealth states and members of the BRICS alliance. Staff Reporter
