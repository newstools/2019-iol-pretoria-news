The sights and sounds came from everywhere despite a public ban on the use of fireworks in specified areas. A warning was sent out by the City as people geared up for the festivities of Christmas and New Year a few weeks ago, in which they said none must be discharged without due permission requested and granted. The call, by Tshwane emergency services, to get written approval for the private discharge of fireworks, was seemingly ignored, as was the order spelling out the strict requirements residents had to adhere to. Yesterday people took to social media to laugh off the ban on the private use of fireworks, particularly in residential areas where young children, the elderly and animals abound. Tshwane had said, in the days leading up to the festive season: “The area where the fireworks are to be discharged must be at least 100m from buildings, roads as well as railway lines. The area where the fireworks will be discharged must be at least 20m from telephone lines, telegraph lines, power lines, trees and overhead obstructions.” “Fireworks are our annual crossover fun we know how to handle ourselves around them,” John Maseko said on Facebook. Lindelwa Mafiyela said the City had more important issues to look at than spoiling their fun. “Drugs are sold openly on the street, sewage spills into our yards; surely that is more important than a few hours of fun, which in fact takes our minds off the stresses of a lack of service delivery,” she wrote. They even gave each other tips on where to find them, and how to discharge them for the best effect, on social media, before going back into their houses to keep dry as the rain continued.
