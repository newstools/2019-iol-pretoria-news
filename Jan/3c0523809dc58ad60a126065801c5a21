They said they had been dealing with the stinking smell and dirt since 2015. Residents told the Pretoria News yesterday that they had complained to their councillor about the trash, but nothing had been done about it. “Most people don't care about this dump site because it does not affect them, but the same cannot be said about us. This dump is literally on our doorstep; we can't even open the windows because of the flies,” said one resident. He said before 2015 all was well in the community as the site was secured and used as a parking space for funeral services. “The problem started when the wall was demolished and there was just an open space; people saw fit to throw their dirt here.” Amon Mohlamme, owner of the Mohlamme Funeral Services, said the dump site was a nightmare. “This is not only a risk to our health but it tarnishes our business's reputation. It is horrible,” he said, pointing to the flies in his office. Mohlamme said he had used the open space as a parking area for his business vehicle. “This used to be a safe space, but we can't say the same now. I have hired someone to clean the portion near the business.” Solomon Makwakwa of the nearby Engen service station said he was the owner of the open area. However, he said he was not aware of the complaints by residents. There was nothing he could do as it was the same community responsible for the dumping. City of Tshwane spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said they were aware of most illegal dumping hot spots. The site in question was part of the broader illegal dumping clearance programme that the City had implemented since September last year. “We clean the spot only for residents to dump again illegally immediately after clearing it.” He promised that the City would look at rehabilitating the site.
