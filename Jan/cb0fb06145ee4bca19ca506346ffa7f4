With Gauteng's township high schools leading the rest of the pack in the country - the time to start improving the quality of the foundation phase education needs to start now. This was the message given to principals, educators, regional heads, parents and learners of the three Soshanguve primary schools where the "Soshanguve Five" attended school. On the second day of schools reopening, Gauteng Premier, David Makhura and Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi gathered learners at the Block X community hall to encourage learners to keep the memory of the five alive by focusing on their education and remaining disciplined. Makhura’s visit follows his announcement during the first commemoration of the deaths in November that he would be adopting the three primary schools and ensure improved education in memory of the five children.

No one can stop us,” were some of the enthusiastic screams of learners that could be heard coming from the Block X hall. Addressing the learners Lesufi said results obtained by the 2018 cohort of learners demonstrated that the stakeholders were working very hard. He said other provinces bore witness to the improvement of education under Makhura’s leadership. With most schools in the province achieving above 80%, Lesufi said it was time to prioritise improving grade Rs and primary school performance.
