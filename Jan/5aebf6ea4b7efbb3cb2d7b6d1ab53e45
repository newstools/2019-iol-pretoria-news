He had been involved in negotiations around the Pacific Alliance - a regional trading bloc made up of Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru - and the extension of trade partnerships with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. He also served as his country’s director of European affairs. He and his wife, Mónica Garaycochea Amat y Leó* de Rubio, quickly settled in their Pretoria home and he presented his credentials to President Cyril Ramaphosa last month. The quiet Christmas period was an opportunity to get to know Pretoria and take his family - including a son who is working and a daughter who is a student - on holiday to Cape Town. Since then he has engaged with diplomatic colleagues, including senior ambassadors from Russia and China. South Africa and Peru established formal diplomatic relations in 1994 and Rubio Correa plans to continue the work achieved in recent years by his predecessors, Daul Matute Mejia and Nicolás Roncagliolo. He hopes to advance bilateral relations, including reaching new agreements in the areas of trade and investment, not only in South Africa but on the continent. There are strong mining ties between the countries and he would like to advance co-operation in areas such as the environment - especially over Antarctica and climate change - and the fight against drugs, as well as promote tourism. He speaks warmly of his home country and the unique opportunity it presents to the thousands of South Africans who travel there annually, mostly to visit the 15th-century Incan ruins of Machu Picchu. There is much to explore and learn in Peru, he said, from the Andes mountains to the Amazon rainforest and desert coast. Other new heads of mission to present credentials to Ramaphosa represent the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, the State of Kuwait and the Republic of Sri Lanka.
