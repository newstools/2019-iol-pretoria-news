Acting director-general of the Department of Transport Chris Hlabisa told mourners at the funeral of two of the victims that communities should assist in finding the perpetrators of cable theft. He said the reason many train accidents occurred was due to cable theft which forced the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa to resort to manual signalling methods, resulting in many human errors. “The people who steal cables are no strangers; the community knows them and they need to work with us and the police in order to stop such accidents from happening again,” he said. The Rail Safety Regulator preliminary report on the crash reflected that a communication breakdown and the use of manual signalling were the cause of the crash. The report also stated that the signalling system had problems since November last year. Both trains were travelling along the same line on the Pretoria-Mabopane route when they crashed into each other. Three people died in the accident and 600 other passengers were injured. The dead are Dick and Sarah Sekoma, 38 and 39 respectively, of Block M in Soshanguve, and 61-year-old Samuel Baloyi. He was also laid to rest at the weekend following a funeral service at his home in Block MM. Sekoma’s family representative Tsakane Nkumane said the couple was inseparable and did everything together. “On their wedding day they promised they would love each other till death do them part, and they indeed loved each other to their last breath. God knew one could not survive without the other, hence he took them together,” she said. The couple leave behind six children - Boitumelo 18, Paulinah 16, David 12, Sonia, 7, Brendan 6 and Gontse, 3. Nkumane said the family was receiving counselling.
