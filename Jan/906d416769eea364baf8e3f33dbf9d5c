This was the promise made to the pupils at Reitumetse Secondary School in Soshanguve Block L by Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi yesterday. “Thank you for all your hard work that has you standing at the top as the best in the country. Thank you for being the best in the province and showing that it can be done. “As a token of our appreciation for the hard work and pride you have given to this school, we are going to transform this school into a school of the future come January 2020.” Since 2014, the school has achieved with 88.2% that year, followed by 76.4% in 2015, 76.4% for 2016 and 78.8% in 2017. In 2018, it achieved 88.8%. “I hope the rest of our schools take encouragement from this school’s commitment and hard work,” Lesufi said. He also opened a new primary school in Centurion yesterday where he called on parents and communities to guard the investment made in schools by protecting and “ousting” criminals. He said the R70million school was a first of its kind in the province and was built using new technology. He said the method used was called Alternative Construction Technology and would enable the department to build schools to cater to the growing need in the province. “The number of pupils coming to Gauteng is huge and to build a normal school takes us close to 24 months. So these technologies enable us to build in the quickest time possible.” Lesufi said the school had everything the pupils would need. “It has laboratories, libraries, multimedia rooms and everything else these learners will need because we are now focusing on improving primary school education.” The department would be unveiling six more schools using the same technology, he said. The school caters for 1000 pupils previously taught in a “tin shack”, the MEC said. The previous school had no library, no lab or even walkways. See page 4
