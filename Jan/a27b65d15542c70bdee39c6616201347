Two from the city made the Outstanding Achievements list (those who achieved within the top 5% in six or more subjects - Clarice van Zyl of Maragon Mooikloof with seven distinctions and Jacques de Chermont of Southdowns College with eight. Their overall average is 95% or more. Others on the list include Robyn Ferguson and Danica Meiring of Midstream and Nadia Santosuosso of Woodhill. On the list of Commendable Achievements (those who achieved within the top 5% in five subjects) are Caleb Isaacs of Cornwall Hill, Daniella de Figueiredo and Calvin Huysamen of Hatfield Christian School and Mignon Jooste of Midstream. Overall the IEB class of 2018 achieved a pass rate of 98.92% and all those who passed have secured entry to some form of tertiary study. For De Chermont his sister had been a trailblazer for him. He was headboy of his school, had academic colours and played sport at first-team level. De Chermont plans to study veterinary science. A school making history is Reddford House The Hills with its first class of matrics who all passed. The IEB, which administers private school assessments, on Wednesday said the increase in the percentage pass rate for entry to bachelor studies could be attributed to the removal of a list of “designated” subjects required for entry to university. But as schools embraced the pupils collecting their results this morning, and the bulk of matrics waited eagerly for theirs to be released tomorrow, Gauteng MEC Panyaza Lesufi reiterated his call for one national examination for matrics, as opposed to the current system where private schools can opt to write different ones from government schools. He said: “We can’t, as a country, have different standards. Therefore, the call for a single examination for all our children is rational and urgent. There’s no university or workplace strictly for NSC learners (or) IEB learners. We treat them equally post schooling (so) why write different exams?” Pretoria News
