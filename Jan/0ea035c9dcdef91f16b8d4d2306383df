In a tweet, Lesufi challenged the cellphone network to pay Makate or face the wrath of the nation. The countdown started on Sunday. “Hi @Vodacom the countdown starts now, 11 days to go. Please #VodaPayHim by 10am, January 31 or face the wrath of the nation. We are the economy and we can shut it down. We are inundated with messages of support. Let’s avoid this, please #VodaPayHim#VodaCountdown11.” Lesufi’s tweets follow the network operator’s announcement early this month that it had reached a settlement with Makate and would pay reasonable compensation to him for his call-back service idea. Makate, however rejected the announcement. The battle between Vodacom and Makate dates back over a decade. People have rallied behind Lesufi, some even threatening to leave the network operator if they did not pay. Twitter user @LHadebe said: “I am fine without my @Vodacom services the same way I said bye-bye to OUTsurance just felt like tagging some friends I have since walked away from because they gave me bad service. @vodacom please pay the guy his money.” Rudzani Matshili
