There were scores of commuters with minor injuries crying and limping towards transport ferrying them to nearby hospitals in the city. Commuter Rebecca Majola, said the train they were travelling in kept on ringing it's bell for a long time. "All I remember before waking up on the floor of the train was this long bell ringing, followed by the bang and I was out of it." An inconsolable Majola said when she came round she had blood in her mouth and pain all over her body. "I tried to tell three people that I was in pain but they told us to go to the buses as the ambulances were to transport those who could not walk."
