Speaking at the service in Newtown in Johannesburg, the kwaito artist said he had been warned by a friend that his life would be in danger if he set foot in Durban, where the ANC launched its election manifesto at the weekend. The artist said the minister was not happy over public comments he made last year. Minister Mthethwa said the remarks were defamatory. The comments were also a blatant attempt to cause harm and impairment to the dignity and integrity of his person and office, he claimed. The allegations were extremely harmful and warranted his decision to seek relief from the courts of law, the minister added. “It is deeply troubling that one would abuse a platform meant to eulogise and rightfully memorialise an African music icon in the form of Dan Tshanda in such a despicable manner,” he said.
