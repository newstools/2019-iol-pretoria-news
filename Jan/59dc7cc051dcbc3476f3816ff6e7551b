THE three men facing charges of public violence and violations of the Road Traffic Act after they were arrested for their role in the protests outside Shepherd Bushiri’s Enlightened Christian Gathering were granted R500 bail each. Kabelo Tladinyane, Kennedy Nemashongwe and Prince Gcaba appeared in the Pretoria Magistrate's Court this afternoon. The suspects, aged between 25 and 29 believed to be SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco) members, were arrested at the weekend after allegedly burning tyres in the road during the #BushiriMustGo demonstrations outsides the Tshwane Events Centre. The trio was arrested on Sunday evening after police “pounced”on them as they left a tavern in Pretoria West. They appeared in a packed courtroom with Sanco members present to show them support.

"We are meeting with the MEC for community safety and security in Gauteng regarding this concern because it is so disturbing. “Bushiri is the one who must be before the court but instead it’s the opposite,” he said. The case was postponed until February 28.
