Beach-goers claimed they were ordered to leave the beach on December 23 as it was "off-limits" after 8pm, the time the sun sets in Cape Town in summer. Guards apparently claimed to be acting on the authority of the City of Cape Town, but the council denied having any contract and announced it will lay a complaint against the PPA with the private security regulatory authority Prisa. The ANC has also laid complaints with the police while South Africa First Forum says it laid a charge of fraud against the security company. In December, according to reports, SAPS confirmed it was investigating three cases of assault allegedly committed by PPA security guards on duty in Cape Town. The Cape of Good Hope SPCA is due to open a case of animal cruelty against the protesters who dragged a live sheep onto the beach and killed it. Groups descended on the beach over the New Year’s weekend to affirm their rights to visit the beach and “say no to privilege”. This harks back to the protests of the late 1980s against racially segregated beaches. African News Agency (ANA)
