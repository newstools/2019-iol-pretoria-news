They were among thousands across the city who began their 12-year school journey. Under the watchful eye of experienced teachers like Estelle Ehlers, there were no tears. Instead they were ushered quietly into the classroom and were seen concentrating on writing and drawing. Ehlers was impressed and said millennial pupils had a different and unique manner of doing things. There were no tantrums; instead they wanted to start school. Her Grade 1 class, she said, was full of independent and confident young children. Parents were the ones who experienced the bittersweet moment of leaving their children behind at this and other schools. She liked that they did not act like babies. Deputy headmaster Andrew Masogo said the school welcomed about 270 Grade 1 pupils with open arms, and hoped they would be happy and safe. “We want them to socialise so they are able to make friends,” Masogo said. “They seem to be very comfortable. It is like they have been here for ages,” he said. The Pretoria News also visited Doringkloof Primary School where parents got to see their children’s classrooms before giving them a hug and leaving them to their first day at school.
