ILLEGAL or not, fireworks were discharged across the city on Monday night as residents heralded the start of a new year. Animal shelters were anticipating an influx of strays in the aftermath. Founder of Wollies Animal Project, Ciller Trexler, said the shelter had received calls of animals in distress from the loud bangs. Dogs react differently to loud sounds, and try to escape, often leading them to hurt themselves or to get lost. “Dogs hear four times the distance of a human and pick up higher pitched sounds than we do,” Trexler said. According to the law, it is illegal to detonate fireworks within 200m of any hospital, clinic, petrol station, old-age home, nursing home, or animal welfare organisation or institution. However, Trexler said the animal shelter, situated in Onderstepoort Pretoria North, was not spared as people were letting off fireworks until 3am yesterday, this despite the rain. Trexler said the shelter experienced several incidents of dogs being hurt. She had to take one dog to a vet after it scrambled out of its cage in terror and went into another dog’s cage where it was bitten. In another incident, she said they received a call that a dog ran away from home, only to go into another yard where it was bitten by other upset dogs. “Neighbours started discharging fireworks in the early afternoon, and it did not stop until this morning - non-stop, they went on discharging those fireworks and this time it was not just your normal fireworks but bomb crackers,” said Trexler. The discharging of fireworks is an issue every beginning of the year, as animal rights activists and others complain of the distress they cause animals, with rights groups adding they also caused stress to young children, autistic children, the elderly, and people with anxiety. The SPCA also issued warnings and urged people to be cautious in how they discharge fireworks, but people continued regardless.
