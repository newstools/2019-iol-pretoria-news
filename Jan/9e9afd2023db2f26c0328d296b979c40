This follows the revelation - made inadvertently by teachers themselves - of a seating plan that saw white children at the main table in a Grade R class, with black classmates seated separately at a smaller table. The Human Rights Commission is right that it is disconcerting that some teachers still behave like this, but we are not all that surprised because many whites cannot see beyond their inbred prejudice and do not even understand that what they do is wrong. Remember the 2016 case when the mother of a black child found out, in a similar manner through a photo sent to her, that her child was seated alone at a nursery school in Centurion, while white classmates sat together at a table eating cookies? Or the case the year before when Curro Roodeplaat pupils were divided by race as they rode on a bus to a school outing? The schools offer as mitigation that it is a case of language not race, and some white parents believe that too, but what is clear is that these actions are driven at their core by racism. As Mandela said, no one is born hating another because of the colour of their skin. People learn to hate but, equally, they can learn to love. School teachers need to understand the vital role they play in promoting love not race hate at school. And this starts by inviting everyone to sit at the same table.
