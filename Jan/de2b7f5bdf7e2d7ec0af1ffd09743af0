In fact, Prasa said it had made the same remark before the regulator released its report in which it blamed the entity at the weekend. Last week, it emerged that a breakdown in communication between a control officer and a driver led to the crash. This was according to a preliminary report by the regulator, which said that after the driver repeated the authority incorrectly, the train control officer acknowledged the incorrect authority. The regulator said this resulted in the train wrongly entering the section between the Pretoria North and Mountain View stations. In a statement, the regulator said, based on the data received from Prasa, the section from Pretoria North to Mountain View had been operating under manual authorisation since November last year. But Prasa spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng yesterday said this was nothing new. Mofokeng said Prasa made the findings first. “At the time of the accident, trains were authorised manually and we also picked up that human error was also part of the contributors. However, the board of inquiry will go deeper into all issues and key contributors to the accident,” she said. Meanwhile, the United National Transport Union said it was disgusted by the findings. “We are totally disgusted with the total incompetence of Prasa and its arrogance about the lives of millions of commuters and thousands of employees,” general secretary Steve Harris said. He said the accident would not have happened had Prasa implemented the plan that addressed its implementation of manual authorisation as set out in a court order. According to the order, all manual authorisations had to be overseen by a train control officer and a section manager. Pretoria News
