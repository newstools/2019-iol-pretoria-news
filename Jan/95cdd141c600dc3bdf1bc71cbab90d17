But the school has since arranged to accommodate them in other classrooms. Chairperson of the school governing body Solomon Mahlangu, said children were moved to classrooms because “studying under the tree is not a conducive learning environment”. The damaged classrooms were used to teach Grade 10 learners. At least 47 were forced to study in the carport. Another class was overcrowded, with 94 pupils. Mahlangu said the situation negatively affected learning. The roof of another block of classrooms was riddled with gaping holes, after some roof sheets from the nearby building fell on them. Two big trees in the yard were uprooted by the winds. Mahlangu said: “We are happy that the incident happened when the learners were not here. Yesterday, we decided to move those who were learning under the tree into one of the classes.” He said the problem was reported to the department, which dispatched people to inspect the situation. “They said they would come back soon to do repair work,” he said. The school was built in 1977 by the community and it had not been renovated since. According to community members, several complaints were previously raised with the department of education about the dilapidated buildings. They wanted the government to demolish the old structure and replace it with a new one. A parent, Sinah Busang, said: “We have approached the department with requests for a new school, but they have tossed us from pillar to post. “Some officials told us to go and ask for donations from somewhere else. We have been looking for those donations but we are not making progress.” She expressed worries about the condition under which learners were forced to learn, saying it was not conducive for learning. Departmental spokesperson Steve Mabona didn’t respond to questions by the time of publication.
