Spokesperson for SAA Tlali Tlali said yesterday that they were in discussions with the government of Zimbabwe to get the matter settled. Zimbabwe is not the only country owing SAA , and it is believed that the total amount foreign countries are owing is more than R1billion. Other countries believed to be owing SAA include Angola, Nigeria and Senegal. Tlali said part of the amounts due to SAA had been paid by Zimbabwe, but he declined to disclose the amounts. It was believed that Zimbabwe owed $7million (R98m) in tickets. Tladi said there were discussions with the Zimbabwean authorities to settle the debt. “There are ongoing discussions between us and the Zimbabwean authorities to ensure that funds due to SAA are finally and fully repatriated,” said Tlali. “We, however, can indicate that we have received part payment from Zimbabwe and this shows intent and progress towards resolving this matter.” Tlali would not say how much had been paid by Zimbabwe, and the total amount owed by that country. Former finance minister Malusi Gigaba raised this issue during his time at the helm of the National Treasury. Gigaba said none of the countries in Africa had refused to pay. National Treasury said last year that there was movement in terms of repayments, and that between $20m and $25m had been paid by the defaulting countries. SAA has been in financial trouble for a long time with the national carrier requiring bailouts of billions of rand from the government. Opposition parties have complained about the state of affairs at SAA, saying the government needs to sell it to the private sector. However the ANC has objected to any moves to sell the airline, saying it will remain in public hands and only an equity partner can be brought in. The national carrier has also spoken about strategic equity partners, but nothing concrete has come to the table.
