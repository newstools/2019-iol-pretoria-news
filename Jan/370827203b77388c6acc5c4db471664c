If you stumbled across a male pen sketch with dreadlocks at the weekend on any social media platform- that’s the infamous funeral artist Rasta. Mzansi has united to give Lebani Sirenje better known as Rasta a taste of his own medicine. It all started with a Facebook post by Riḓovhona Tsaa Tsaṅwani on Sunday, when he suggested that a challenge be born to get back at the artist for always "disrespecting" late celebrities. “Guys, can we please start a challenge called #DrawRastaChallenge? He needs to feel what we feel every time a celebrity passes on,” the post read. People quickly jumped on the bandwagon drawing the total opposite of what the artist looks like. The challenge saw people drawing the artist wrapping his dreadlocks with a "doek" while wearing a colourful top. Through his paintings, Rasta has paid tribute to late celebrities and prominent figures, including former president Nelson Mandela, Struggle icon Albertina Sisulu, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and gospel stars Lundi Tyamara and Sfiso Ncwane. And he got flak for his work, each time. He ruffled feathers again at the weekend with his painting of late jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi. He painted Mtukudzi’s popular portrait of him wearing a Nigerian male hat but people saw SABC1's Emzini Wezinsizwa character Chirwali, instead. This was after he ignored pleas to not paint the late icon. Sirenje has once again been accused of having “had too much weed” before his painting. Twitter users are saying the man depicted in the artwork is not the icon and that he needed to paint that “stranger in front of his own house”. They once again questioned his optical health. People have also called for his paintbrushes to be confiscated. Take a look at some the drawings:  The #DrawRastaChallenge on the village called Facebook went something like this#Thread #Gallery pic.twitter.com/lOX2pJnYpl #DrawRastaChallenge rate me out of 5 😁 pic.twitter.com/8ZeLLc5379 Let's do a #drawRastachallenge and show him how he looks !!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/HSoxQSiBk9 Here is my drawing #DrawRastaChallenge pic.twitter.com/SFPatLvlPf Don't miss out on the #DrawRastaChallenge where we'll be drawing Rasta to give him the taste of his own medicine #DateMyFamilly #PinkODI pic.twitter.com/RrVvoAMkrZ #DrawRastaChallengeI can draw Rasta too 😎😎 pic.twitter.com/72z66l36WX #drawRastachallenge pic.twitter.com/JycaP15UJl #drawrastachallenge pic.twitter.com/ZDiQNkGSqh #drawrastachallenge pic.twitter.com/4omefkIILO Rasta is back at it again. pic.twitter.com/neEJDVxKya
