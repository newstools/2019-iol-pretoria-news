The suspension was to allow investigations to continue, he added. Lehari said the school’s explanation was that black children were separated because they were new at the school and could not speak Afrikaans or English. “We did not accept the explanation,” he said. A photo showing a small group of black children sitting at a table away from white children went viral on social media and raised the ire of political parties. Irate parents said yesterday that they did not believe their children were safe at the school. “I was shocked to see young children in that position,” said one parent. Yesterday, protesters, many donning political party T-shirts, had gathered outside the school gates to protest against what they termed was racial segregation at the establishment. “The incident happened at a class next to my child’s class. She was not affected but this segregation cannot continue. Our children cannot experience what our parents went through during apartheid,” said the mother. While protesters sang and danced outside, some parents of white children broke a part of the fence on the other side of the school to gain access and in order to remove their children. Lehari urged residents to allow his department to investigate the issue and not to be judgemental. A teacher reportedly sent the controversial picture to parents via WhatsApp intending to show them how their children were settling in on their first day at school on Wednesday. The National Freedom Party called for the school to shut down, saying it strongly condemned the racist segregation of learners. “These schools’ tendencies of segregating learners based on the colour of their skin is against the principles of the democratic South Africa we live in today,” said spokesperson Sabelo Sigudu. The party blamed the government, which it said neglected public and rural schools. Some social media users called for a slaughter of a sheep at the school, replicating what occurred at Clifton Beach in Cape Town recently.
