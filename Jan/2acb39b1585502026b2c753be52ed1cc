The school, like its neighbours, said it had invested time and effort to ensure the matric learners scored as many distinctions as possible, in order to secure places in the country’s top universities. And here too the pupils who had finished school were back, waiting with friends and family to collect the all-important envelopes. Keatlegile Mashele, 17, Lesego Matji, 18, Ciara Anning, 17, Caitlin Mollentze, 18, and Deniel Darmant, 18, arrived early at Midstream College to received their results with smiles on their faces, obtaining numerous distinctions between them. They said they knew exactly what they wanted to study and could already imagine themselves as career professionals after completing their tertiary studies in a few years from now. Keatlegile said she already saw herself studying accounting science at Wits, and Lesego could not wait to start attending LLB Law lectures at the University of Pretoria. Deniel said: "I am going to study 3D animation at the Cape Town Animation School. "I love animation and am well aware I may even have to relocate to Canada after completing my studies for some better employment opportunities.” Midstream College vice-academic head Madeline Matthys said the school had received a 100% pass rate, with 438 distinctions from 157 matriculants, and 98.7% of pupils already had university acceptance.
