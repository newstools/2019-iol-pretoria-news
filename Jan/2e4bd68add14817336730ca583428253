Three informal traders in Ga-Rankuwa yesterday stated they were not interested in the voter registration weekend, or in the general polls later this year. So disgruntled are they with the ANC-led government that they go as far as comparing it with that of the now defunct Lucas Mangope-led Bophuthatswana Bantustan. But the democratic right to vote is way bigger than the government they say has not delivered its promises with regards to jobs and housing; it is also not about the government of the day headed by the ANC. It is well documented how blood was shed to ensure that we earned the right to vote and enjoy the freedom we have today. Before deciding to give up your right to vote, think of what Nelson Mandela, Bantu Biko, Solomon Mahlangu, Winnie Madikizela Mandela, Walter and Albertina Sisulu, Oliver and Adelaide Tambo and other freedom fighters would do if feeling disillusioned with the government. You can bet your last cent that they would stand up and act, not withhold their vote. In conclusion, some food for thought: bad politicians are elected by good people who donâ€™t vote - and every nation gets the government it deserves. We sincerely hope citizens not on the voters roll or needing to verify their details will flock to the voting stations this weekend and subsequently cast their ballot in the election in order to vote for the government they deserve. Happy weekend, Pretoria
