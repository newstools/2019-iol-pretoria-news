They were taken to a private mortuary in Pretoria West. Police yesterday slammed the church for not reporting the incident to the police. Three females had died and 12 were injured during a “stampede to get into the church” during a thunderstorm on Friday afternoon. The injured congregants were taken to Kalafong Hospital and Pretoria West Hospital. Yesterday police spokesperson Captain Kay Makhubela, explained the proper procedure. “When this type of thing happens you either phone an ambulance or the police, so paramedics can check if they can resuscitate the person. If the person has died they certify the death.” He stressed “only authorised people” were allowed to remove bodies, “not paramedics or a person from a private mortuary”. Bushiri's lawyer, Terrance Baloyi, said: “We suspended the head of the church who runs the Pretoria branch pending investigations.” People discussed the bizarre incident on social media. Facebook user Mampe Deborah Letsoale said she had found her mom at RedFord mortuary two days later. “She passed away on December 28 due to Bushiri's church's stampede. We were sent from pillar to post by Bushiri's people they kept my mom's body at their mortuary in Saulsville.”
