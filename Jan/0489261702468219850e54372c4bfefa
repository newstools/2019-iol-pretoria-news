This as the last batch of holidaymakers made their way back to the city with Transport Minister Blade Nzimande expected to announce the festive season road deaths statistics tomorrow. During the holidays, Nzimande said that the road deaths had increased by 16% between December 1 and 18 when compared with figures for the same period for the previous year. The minister had revealed that this brought the total of fatalities to 767 up to that point. The picture was also looking grim in the capital city. Metro police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said: “We have put together a quick summary of the carnage blighting our roads, and it’s not exactly what we’d call an easy read. These figures have to be seen to be believed,” he added. During the holiday period, arrests and traffic violations recorded during crime prevention and by-law enforcement operations included 216620 speedsters caught on camera and 880 caught overloading goods and passengers. Another 20908 traffic tickets were issued for the use of cellphones while driving, disobeying traffic signs, vehicle defects and inconsiderate driving. Spokesperson for the Bakwena Platinum Corridor Concessionaire, Charmaine van Wyk, said that the N1 Phumulani Plaza route had been busy over the weekend. “Volumes did exceed 1500 vehicles an hour through Pumulani and Carousel. "We are expecting normal volumes this week as private schools open on Wednesday and most people are back at work,” she added. Van Wyk said that the N4 was less busy than the N1, with vehicles peaking at 1400 an hour. The Pretoria bus station was again a bustle of activity as hordes of people made their way back to the capital city.
