Kumalo also served as co-chairperson for the establishment of the UN Human Rights Council, and was chairperson at the UN of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Southern African Development Community and the Group of 77 plus China. As an anti-apartheid campaigner, ambassador Kumalo played an influential role in the process that led to the UN’s declaration of apartheid as a crime against humanity.
