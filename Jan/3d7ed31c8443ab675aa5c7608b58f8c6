Gauteng Health MEC Dr Gwen Ramokgopa swooped in the early hours of the morning at Kalafong Hospital in Atteridgeville to monitor service delivery at the facility. Ramokgopa interacted with patients and staff. She went on a walkabout visiting wards in the hospital asking patients and staff what they think the health department could help with and to hear complaints about service delivery at the hospital. She walked in and out of wards introducing herself and asking "how can I make your stay or work easier" to both staff and patients. Among the issues that came out was the need for staff, shortages of beds and waiting time. "We are trying to get the feeling of young people in terms of using our health system," Ramokgopa said. The MEC’s hospital visit was followed by a visit to Makgwaraneng Primary School in Saulsville as part of the school health and teenage learner pregnancy programme. She used the platform to create awareness around the high teenage pregnancy in Tshwane as part of the undertaking made last year at the launch of the Health, Wellness and Happiness Campaign to prioritise school health programmes. She told pupils to look after their bodies. “Your bodies are not ready to have babies, please wait,” she said.
