The 30-year-old international model, businessman and former Sharks player from Cape Town is starting his search for a possible soulmate. At a cocktail party last week, the hunk revealed that viewers should expect drama, emotions and entertainment from the show. Thompson appeared suave, dressed to the nines. The party was part of the three-day M-Net channels media showcase at Gold Reef City, where new shows coming up this season were revealed. It was revealed that the local heartthrob would be the lucky man vying for the hearts of 24 beautiful and accomplished South African women from different backgrounds. The show received over 3000 applications. Another show to look out for is the new season of The Voice SA,which makes a splash on February 3. There were sessions with the four coaches - Francois van Coke, Lira, Riana Nel and Ricky Rick - about their experiences working on the show. During the show’s “blind auditions”, the coaches sit with their backs to the stage, judging the talent on their vocal abilities only. If they like what they hear, they push a button to swivel their chairs around to see the singer. The show is hosted by Anele Mdoda. “It was a great competition, great talent, so it has been really amazing, but what hurts is having to let a talent go without even turning a chair to see who it is, or giving them advice on how they can improve,” Lira said. Finding The One is another show that will blow viewers’ minds. It is a spin on the reality dating concept - entries open on Valentine’s Day. The media was also part of The Wedding Bashers season finale recording aired last night.
