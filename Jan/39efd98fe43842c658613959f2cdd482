Pretoria - The DA intensified its campaigning in Mamelodi's this morning ahead of the National elections in May as they hoped to galvanise support and win. The party's leader Mmusi Maimane was joined by Tshwane executive mayor Solly Msimanga as they went to see Denneboom informal traders encouraging people along the way to go out in their numbers to register to vote. Maimane said they wanted to ensure the DA won decisively. Maimane said he was confident the party would emerge victorious and trump the ANC. This despite a recent poll released by Ipsos predicting that 6 out of 10 voters will cast their votes for the ANC.
