Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has called on parents and communities to guard the investment made in schools by protecting and "ousting" criminals. Lesufi was speaking at the opening of a new primary school in Centurion, Pretoria earlier today. According to Lesufi the school worth R70 million, was a first of it's kind in the province that the department had built with new technology. He said the methods used were called Alternative Construction Technology and would enable them to build schools to cater to the ever growing needs in the province. "The number of learners coming to Gauteng are so huge and to build a normal school takes us close to 24 months. So this technology enables us to build in the quickest time possible." Lesufi said the school was beautiful and had everything the learners would need. "It has laboratories, libraries, multimedia rooms and everything else these learners will need because we are now focusing on improving primary school education." He said the department would be unveiling six more schools using the same technology. The school which caters for a 1000 learners, was said to be much better as they were previously in a "tin shack" that left much to be desired. With over a 1000 learners to cater for, the previous school had no library, no lab or even walkways either, according to Lesufi. He said he was disappointed that a school in Tsakani, Duduza where they had mobilised the community regarding its construction was still broken into. "We can't be terrorised by a few in our communities robbing our children of their future. The community there must tell us who stole those things so that we can hand them over to the police. "A school must be protected. And it is the communities job to take ownership of these investments we are making for our children."
