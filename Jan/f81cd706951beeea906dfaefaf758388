Still scrambling for a Valentine's date? If so, you might just want to tune in to M-Net (DStv 101) as your date, Lee Thompson awaits you at 7:30 pm when The Bachelor SA premieres. Join the 30-year-old international model, businessman and former Sharks rugby player from Cape Town, as he starts his journey looking for a possible soulmate. And last night during a cocktail party, the hunk reveled that viewers should expect drama, emotions and entertainment among other things, from the show. Thompson appeared suave, dressed to the nines while the media made it a point to don their best in order to impress him. The party was part of the three-day M-Net Channels Media Showcase held at Gold Reef City, where they revealed some of the new shows coming up this season. Another show to look out for is the new season of The Voice SA. The media was treated for the premier episode, which comes to the screens on February 3. There were sessions with the four coaches - Francois Van Coke, Lira, Riana Nel and Ricky Rick - about their experiences so far working on the show. South Africa's much loved television personality Anele Mdoda, who is the show's host, also graced the occasion. Finding The One is another show that will blow viewers' minds. It is an entertaining spin on the reality dating concept. Pretoria News
