LACK of water around the Odi area in Mabopane caused the Gauteng Education’s Tshwane West District to shut its gates to any of the public queries today; much to parents' fury. Many already fed-up parents gathered at the district offices in Odi in the hope of getting school placements for their children. Security guards put the “no water” sign at the gates and disgruntled parents told them it was not water they wanted at the district but placement for their children. "We don't want your water, we just want placements for our children. We use money to come here and not being assisted each time we get here is actually frustrating," yelled one of the parents who refused to be named. One of the parents who was inside the premises, Ledile Mashiane from Mabopane told the Pretoria News that due to lack of water, they were given forms to fill in and leave them at the district. “They said they will try their best to place the children and as much as we are not happy that we are leaving without a hundred percent assurance that our children will be placed, I however, understand why they said we should leave. The place is starting to smell due to bathrooms being used without any water and no one should work in such an environment," she said. It was said that the area has been out of water since Thursday. Meanwhile, other parents refused to return home and asked to be assisted as it was not water they needed but rather space for their children.
