Munyai, who comes from Limpopo, arrived in Pretoria on Wednesday and was the first contestant in the queue. It was his second audition after his dream of succeeding in last year's competition did not come true. Munyai said he had forgotten about his past disappointments and was raring to reach for the stars. But the would-be musician received unanimous nays from all the judges. He performed the famous Vusi Nova's tune Ndikuthandile. Visibly heartbroken, Munyai said: “I don't know what the Idols judges are looking for because I am a multi-talented musician. I am telling you if Vusi Nova was one of the judges he was going to give me a ‘yes’ because I performed his song so beautifully.” As he descended the stage, he said he started singing softly Soul Kulture’s song Ngeliny’ilanga. “The song encourages me to soldier on and not to lose hope. I was born with the singing talent. Right now I am going to focus on building my musical career,” he said. One of the contestants at the State Theatre was Omphethetse Digopeleng, who said: “My wish is to be living proof to the next generation that it is possible for a rural girl with global dreams to actually chase her dreams and live them, thus paving the way for them to also have faith accompanied by action towards achieving their dreams.” Natalie Moos, 23, from the Northern Cape, auditioned for the first time with the song One and Only by Adele. Some contestants started queuing up to audition from Friday night. Those who didn't make the cut to the next round said they were willing to travel to Carnival City next weekend to try their luck again in the Joburg auditions.
