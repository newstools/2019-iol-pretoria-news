Pretoria - More people are still believed to be trapped inside the two trains which collided in Mountain View, Pretoria, on Tuesday. Metrorail spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng said they are prioritising the rescue mission to get to the trapped passengers. It is not clear how many people remain trapped. "For now we don't have the full details of what caused the accident," she said. So far three people have been declared dead and two are reportedly critically injured.

"I don't want to speculate about what happened this morning because they are still investigating. But I think there's a need now to immediately have a meeting with Prasa (Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa). We cannot lose anymore lives, there needs to be some kind of upgrade in terms of signalling that is in here." Msimanga said he plans to meet with the families of the deceased.
