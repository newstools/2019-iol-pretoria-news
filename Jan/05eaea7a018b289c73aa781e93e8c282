Pretoria - Many parents decided to wait for the last minute before schools open to buy uniforms for their children. Long queues are the order of the day outside school-wear shop Constantia Uitrusters in Menlo Park. There are hordes of parents, some pulling their little children to the shops to fit their new clothes hoping they would still find uniforms. From about 9am the shop was a hive of activity. But the last-minute wait brought bad news for some. "I did not get everything because the shop has run out of stock," said a disappointed Melissa Louw. She said Constantia was the only shop selling her daughter's uniform. "I got the list of things required from the school early and I had the money to buy them, but somehow I decided to wait until after Christmas. Now I regret my decision," she said. She said she expected to spend more than R900 on her daughter's summer uniform and an extra R400 in winter. Lesego Malatji from Mamelodi said she had received the money late for her two daughters' uniforms. "There was no queue in December and if I had the money I would have bought everything then," she said, moving slowly towards the counter. Some customers questioned the monopoly that certain shops have on school uniforms. They said it was not fair to have only one shop selling school uniforms for certain schools because they tend to be expensive.
