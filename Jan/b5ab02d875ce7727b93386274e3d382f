Brookfield Investments, which owns the land in Park Street where residential units are being built, said it feared for the safety of its workers as death threats were levelled against them by disgruntled people who did not get jobs at the site. Project manager Beyers Lategan said in papers before court the company was developing a high density residential development consisting of about 222 units. The cost is estimated at about R220million. The company has already invested about R40m in the project. The property was handed over to a contractor who started construction late last year. A few days later, people arrived at the property and said they wanted to work there. Lategan stated that at that stage the meeting was amicable and the people were told there were no jobs available. The building continued without interruptions for about a week until about 20 people arrived. They were aggressive and demanded that all construction activities be stopped. They threatened the employees and contractors and demanded access to the property. As the main gate was locked, the group threw bricks at the workers and tried to break the lock. One of the men shouted at the workers that “somebody is going to die today”. Lategan said he told the team to stop working and leave the property to ensure their safety. The security guards had to remain behind to guard the property and Lategan said they understandably feared for their lives. The intruders then locked the gate with their own lock. Lategan said the police were phoned, but said they could not interfere unless there was an interdict in place. The project is due to be completed by October. Lategan said they would have to pay R60273 a day in interest if the work was not completed by then. The group was interdicted by Judge Selby Baqwa from threatening and intimidating workers. They may not block the entrance to the building site.
