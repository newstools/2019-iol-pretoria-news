The hashtag #101ThingsINeverDid is trending on Twitter and memes are flooding in. The hashtag which sent social media users into a frenzy for all of Thursday morning sees people ‘confessing’ things they have never done in their entire life. From relationships to fashion, you name it. While some of the confessions are a bit emotional, many of the things shared have since sent Twitter into a spin and a barrel of laughs. In one of the confessions, someone said while others were quick to fill cinemas to watch the Black Panther movie last year, she  belonged to ‘that’ small population that has never watched it even today. Another tweep jokingly said he has never reached the exchange of bank pins or payslips stage in a relationship. And while others are quick to take part in social media challenges all the time,@MfKhumalo said he has never participated in any, as real life challenges kept him busy all the time. Here are some of the confessions made:   Never had a date on the 14th of Feb😂 #101ThingsINeverDid pic.twitter.com/YBq1f87pv1 #101ThingsINeverDid Celebrate anniversary in a relationship 😢😢😢😢 pic.twitter.com/BuuUjV1FUc #101ThingsINeverDidNever broke up with all of partner .
