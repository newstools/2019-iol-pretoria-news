Their journey begins this weekend with the return of Idols SA auditions, which kick off at the State Theatre before going nationwide. The show, which is a contest to determine the country's best young singers, is in its 15th Season, will launch the auditions and then criss-cross the country in search of the ultimate winner. On February 9, those in Durban will gather at North Beach Amphitheatre for auditions. Joburg gets its turn at Ellis Park on February 16. The last auditions will be on March 2 at Century City in Cape Town. Registrations will open at 8am and ID, or proof of identification, is required. And while the queues are often very long, participants are encouraged to claim their spots early. They are also advised to bring water to keep hydrated, food and a song that suits their voice. The organisers have said those who have auditioned before are also welcome to re-enter, but not from the previous top 10. “Anyone who is a South African citizen between the ages of 16 and 30 may enter Idols. Minors must have written consent signed by a parent or guardian.” While the premiere date is yet to be announced, the show will be screened on Mzansi Magic every Sunday. There will also be a dedicated Idols channel. The show will also be available on DStv Catch Up once the show has aired. The full prize package is yet to be confirmed, but the winner will win a recording contract, among other big prizes. Voting will open during live shows at the top 16 phase of the competition, after Theatre Week, which normally takes contestants to Sun City.
