The 18-year-old from Eldoraigne was humbled to find out yesterday morning, when he went to collect his results, that he had scored eight distinctions with an average of 89%. But it was only a few weeks ago that he had a change of heart regarding his planned studies at Wits, deciding against actuarial science and switching to medicine. After his mother died when he was just 14, Ammen swore he would never become a doctor because of the strenuous work and long hours. “At first I did not want to do it, but the thing is I feel it is in my genes to study medicine. I wanted to pursue actuarial science, but after finishing my exams I realised that no matter how much you grind for something, if you do not enjoy it it is useless. You cannot be good at something unless it is your passion.” Ammen described how passing “with stars” did not come naturally, but he treated his matric year as a journey to work on himself. He had to dig deep to find his inner strength. His classmate Dominique Binns scored seven distinctions, but felt that even though she did very well, she would rather travel in Europe first this year, and will volunteer at the UN, but she says she will study crisis management next year. “Matric is so far behind me, which is why I am taking a gap year. My marks are not really that important “ I just want to explore what is out there as I have been in such an enclosed environment. “I sort of know what I want to study, but I want to experience the world while I still can,” she said. Crawford College Pretoria’s top IEB 10 also include Saien Naidoo, who got eight distinctions, as well as Tasiya Essorp. Those with seven distinctions include Audrey Kuchio and Esther Slobber; and Zoe Balyamujura, Nabeeiah Ismail, Saarah Patel and Chantell Walker each achieved six distinctions.
