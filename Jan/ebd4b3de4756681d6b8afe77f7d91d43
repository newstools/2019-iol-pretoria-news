The South African team did not lay a charge themselves, but the match referee, Ranjan Madugalle of Sri Lanka, started the procedure of an investigation, having been made aware of the incident. He is expected to interview several players and then decide upon a course of action. The Proteas player was nonplussed by Sarfraz’s comments because they were made in a language he didn't understand. Television cameras and the stump microphones picked up Ahmed saying something in his native Urdu, and that comment was widely shared on social media. Loosely translated, his comments were: “Hey black guy, where's your mother sitting today? “What prayer have you got her to say for you today?” - supposedly in reference to Phehlukwayo’s fortune at the crease. South African team officials confirmed to Independent Media that they were aware of the incident. “We are aware of the incident. It is in the hands of the match referee now, and we cannot comment any further until we have received the results of the investigation,” Proteas team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee was quoted as saying. According to the “ICC Anti-Racism Policy for International Cricket - 1 October 2012”, the ICC and all of its members should “not at any time offend, insult, humiliate, intimidate, threaten, disparage, vilify or unlawfully discriminate between persons based on their race, religion, culture, colour, descent, and/or national or ethnic origin (inappropriate racist conduct”. Man-of-the-match Phehlukwayo went on to record a career-best score of 69 not out, on top of four wickets, as he helped South Africa to a series-levelling victory. Pakistan won the first match in Port Elizabeth on Saturday night. The third match of the series is scheduled for SuperSport Park Centurion tomorrow.
