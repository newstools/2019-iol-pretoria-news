Barely a month into the new year and Limpopo musician King Monada is at it again. And this time, he has people engaged in a challenge where they are dragging their luggage, going back to their relationships. Motho Kadi Bag was released four days ago. It features DJ Solira. In the song, the Malwedhe hitmaker talks about a partner who suddenly returns back home-without their partner or spouse’s consent - after they had disappeared following a misunderstanding. The song has led to what came to be known as the #MothoKadiBagChallenege. In videos shared rapidly on different social media platforms since its release, fans are seen dragging their luggage, dancing while at it. Rapper Cassper Nyovest also posted a video dancing to the song yesterday, carrying a sports bag. While some have slammed the dance more videos kept flooding in this morning under #MothoKadiBag and #PhashaPhashaKadiBag. Some tweeps have since poked fun at those participating in memes and witty videos. Last year, the musician released a song called Malwedle, which led to the #IdibalaChallenge. Here are some of the videos:  #KingMonada new hit #MothoKaDiBag@KingMonada 💃💃 pic.twitter.com/VVnMfi9g4n Motho So Kadi bag 😂 King Monada while I was busy with Benz now this hit pic.twitter.com/oLTRXSBJgD #MothoKadiBagLaundry day😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/rQiGx8H00A All thanks to @KingMonada_ Motho Šu Kadi Bag 💼🎒.
