Pretoria - Police are on the hunt for a man in his thirties in connection with the 'rape' of a 20-year-old woman from Nellmapius. Brooklyn police station spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach said the man who was wearing a balaclava had cut the victim’s underwear with a knife and raped her. “Early Sunday morning at about 3am a 20-year-old woman woke up and saw an unknown man outside her open bedroom window. He was wearing a balaclava and pointed a firearm at her. He instructed her to hand him her laptop and cellphone through the window. She was then instructed to open the door for him. Once inside her house he cut her underwear with a knife and raped her,” she said. Weilbach  said the suspect entered the house and found the woman sleeping next to her children. “He instructed her to keep quiet and to hand him money, which she did. "After he ransacked the house he raped her.  He also used a knife to threaten her.” The possibility is also being investigated that he could also be linked to other cases, she added. The investigating officers believe that it could be the same perpetrator who raped and robbed a woman last year in November inside her house, also in Nellmapius. The incident also occurred during the early hours of a Sunday morning,” she added. He has a light complexion, smokes and speaks Pedi. The SAPS has made an urgent appeal to members of the public to assist them with their investigation by providing information that may lead to the arrest of the suspect in the identikit provided.
