With the institution officially kicking off its registration period across all campuses today, it reported that things were still going well despite people taking to social media to complain about problems with online registration last week. Spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said their online registration had picked up high traffic volumes of students trying to get registered and submit their results following the release of the 2018 matric results. Over 41000 matric pupils in Gauteng alone obtained university entrance passes, while TUT only had space for 15000 students. She said it was for this reason that it appeared to some prospective students who were attempting to register that the system had crashed. “The last we heard everything was still going ahead with no hiccups. Yes, the system is slow because there are so many students looking to further their education, but it is working.” Students have been advised, as with previous years, that no walk-ins would be allowed onto any of the university’s campuses. Current students and first-year students who had already received confirmation of acceptance and may have to visit campuses to attend interviews or see to other matters, were advised to seek help, upon arrival, from assistants with bibs that proclaimed: “Ask Me”. De Ruyter added that the registration period was faculty based and, despite warnings from the university that no walk-ins would be allowed, students still came through, particularly at the Soshanguve campuses. She said that they were not expecting any trouble at the previously unstable TUT Soshanguve campuses as there was a plan in place to ensure their stability. Students have been advised to bring proof of registration, a 2018 student ID card, their ID and a printed copy of the communication they had received from the institution. Any enquiries should be directed through the university call centre, at 0861102421, and relevant information would be continually updated on the TUT website.
