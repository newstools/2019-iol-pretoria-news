Their protest march will culminate in the unveiling of a billboard that shows the human cost of the ANC’s 24 years in government. The party said while the ANC has enriched itself over the years, there has been a literal body count of South Africans who have fallen victim to that party's neglect and failure in government. “South Africans have been subjected to one of the worst governance periods under the ANC which has plunged the country into unacceptable levels of poverty and a crippling jobs crisis. Communities have become war zones, provision of basic services has come to a grinding halt, and millions of our children have been let down by a failing education system.” Also participating will be Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba, DA provincial health spokesperson Jack Bloom, regional chairperson Heinrich Volmink, national spokesperson Refiloe Nt’sekhe, provincial leader John Moodey and federal chairperson Athol Trollip. The party said it would also have campaign spokesperson Solly Malatsi, its parliamentary chief whip John Steenhuisen, Team One SA spokesperson on corruption Phumzile van Damme, and federal youth leader Luyolo Mphithi at the march, which will start at 10.45am from the Westgate transport hub on the corner of Anderson Street and Pat Mbatha busway.
