Tweeps have expressed disappointment after streams of R Kelly's music on Spotify reportedly increased since Surviving R. Kelly premiered last week. Lifetime aired the first part of the six-episode expose on Thursday night which investigates long-standing allegations made against Kelly that he has sexually and physically abused women and teenage girls over a number of years. The 51-year-old R&B legend has since vehemently denied the accusations, further threatening to take legal action. According to The Blast, Spotify spokesperson confirmed Kelly’s streams increased 16 percent after the aired part 1 of the docuseries premiered. Celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith, John Legend and Pearl Thusi have weighed in on the issue.  The docuseries garnered a lot of attention around the world, with many slamming the singer. Here are some of the reactions to reports that streams have increased:  Let’s not make the mistake people made with r.kelly! We can’t keep supporting his music Looking up R. Kelly’s name on Twitter is such a bad idea. It’s mad how many deluded people there are so ready to defend him just because he’s made songs they like Following the whole R Kelly docu series and I am in disgust. I can't believe he is still out there. How can you do that to that many black women. How?? #BlackGirlsMatter I've now watched the entire 'Surviving R Kelly' docuseries and the term 'horrified' doesn't cut it. We must speak out with our community and we must condemn this alleged monstrous behaviour. #MeToo #MuteRKelly This is disgusting and sad. No wonder he believes he can get away with anything he does. How can anyone listen to his music in good conscience? #BlackGirlsMatter #MuteRKelly
