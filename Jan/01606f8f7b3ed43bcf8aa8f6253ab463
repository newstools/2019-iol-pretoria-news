On Saturday, more than 500 participants took part in the event, held at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa, or Pretoria Zoo. They stopped and took pictures of the animals along the way, particularly of flamingos and elephants. Couple Kelebogile and Lefentse Makoko from Montana said the walk was amazing, especially because it came with a bit of sightseeing. “It is so refreshing to walk around here while seeing animals; it is absolutely amazing,” Lefentse said. Mother and daughter Lebogang and Mankwana Modiba from Pretoria North said of all the animals they saw, they loved watching the blue crane. “Apart from this being about fitness, seeing animals so early in the morning is refreshing and very nice. I will definitely take part in the race again,” said the mother. Organiser and Friends of the Zoo chairperson Henning Smit said the walk was held every third Saturday of each month to raise funds for maintenance work at the zoo. The organisation is run by a group of volunteers who ensure that the maintenance at the zoo and its farmhouse is of good standard for animal lovers who frequent the facility every week.
