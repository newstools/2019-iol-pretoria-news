Mahlatsi asked that residents near universities accommodate at least one or two students and offer them transport as well as other requirements they may have. To put her money where her mouth is, she offered three prospective students a place to stay at her home. “If there are students from other provinces who don’t have friends or family this side or resources to book accommodation and need to sort out few things, please note that I am offering free accommodation at my place in Centurion East.” She stated that she had a spare room which could be shared by two people and was willing to share her bedroom with another person. “I am also willing to drive the students to and from campus when needed,” she said. Mahlatsi urged other people to lend a helping hand and open their homes to those in need. “Let us open our homes, comrades; this thing of poor students from other provinces sleeping at Park Station while sorting out their registration when we have apartments must come to an end.” Mahlatsi further appealed to student leaders assisting with applications and registrations to be on the lookout for students standing in queues with luggage as this indicated they did not have a place to sleep. “We must do everything possible to ensure that no student sleeps in toilets on campuses or Park Station.” Mahlatsi told the Pretoria News she was a student at Rhodes University during the #FeesMustFall unrest and got to understand struggles that most students faced. She said there was no reason why students needed to sleep in parks and other areas when there were people with flats who could assist. Athenkosi Mayana from the Eastern Cape who was provided with accommodation while she sorted out her registration process wrote a heartfelt “thank you” message to all those who assisted her through her journey.
