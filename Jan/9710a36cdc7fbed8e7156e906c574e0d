Police have called on residents of Eldoraigne, Wierdabrug, Valhalla and The Reeds to do what they can to protect their gate motors. Wierdabrug police spokesperson Captain Agnes Huma said this type of theft was on the increase. There was also a worrying trend of suspects deactivating the gate motor and accessing the property while on manual override. “More residents are reporting their gate motors stolen. We are calling on the community to assist us to fight these crimes,” she said. Replacing the gate motors can cost up to R7000. The theft of gate motors and their batteries is no new phenomenon. Huma said: “We are still trying to establish why criminals are back to stealing gate motors. We are appealing to the public for helpful information.” Some residents believed that the culprits were stealing the gate motors to re-install them elsewhere. They could also be stolen either to be stripped down and the components sold individually, or sold as complete units to unsuspecting homeowners by these “access automation bandits”. An Eldoraigne resident, who declined to be named, said a group of about four males claiming to be from the City of Tshwane, who were working outside his yard last week, were to blame. By the time he returned from lunch, his gate motor was gone, the resident said. A week earlier it happened to his friend in Valhalla at night. “There is no pattern of how and when. It can be any time of day or night and it can be at any street.” Huma said criminals were also not shy to strike a second time once a battery had been replaced. She urged people to mark their gate motors or write down the serial number. “This could help us pinpoint any suspect caught with a gate motor under suspicious circumstances.”
