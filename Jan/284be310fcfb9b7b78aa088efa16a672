The parents, who gathered at the Sunnyside Teacher Development Centre, became frustrated and their patience wore thin as they pushed to try to get into the building and speak to officials. They were given forms to fill in and then told to wait, but for some it was another disappointing day as they were told they could not be helped immediately. Their children are among about 16000 pupils in the province still to be placed in Grade 1 and Grade 8. The department said it received a total of 24228 late applications - those made after the extended deadline for online applications last year. A 28-year-old mother was among those in the queue. She said she was trying to transfer her children - one starting Grade 1 and the other in Grade 5 - to a school in Pretoria as she had moved here from Nelspruit after her mother fell ill. “Every child has a right to education and this feels like a blockage to education. “If a parent has to go through the process of sleeping here and leaving without being helped, what is the point of the education system?” she asked in despair. Another parent said her application for her son for Grade 8 had been pending for months. “I do not know if I should buy a uniform. It might be possible that our children could only go to school in February just because we have to wait for a call.” Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi urged parents not to panic as the department was working hard to place their children in schools. The department yesterday continued to encourage parents to visit the district offices for assistance. Lesufi had said the department had been concerned by the late registration rush but assured parents all children would be placed.
