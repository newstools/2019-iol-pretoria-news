Ahead of the voter registration weekend ANC Deputy President David Mabuza addressed TUT main campus students as part of the parties voter registration drive in Tshwane. Mabuza also visited Prasa offices in Marabastad, following complaints from commuters on his blitz and walkabout in the area in the morning. He also went on a door-to-door campaign in Atteridgeville. In a bid to encourage students to vote he told them to keep going even though they faced issues such as outstanding fees. He said the students should prepare themselves to run the country, and that freedom was not delivered on a silver platter but was fought for. He said the only way to sustain democracy was for the youth to also take part in registering to vote. "I am told that in this university our structures are in command in driving the process of transformation. "You will see more of me coming here grappling with your issues. We are not going to retreat and we know the majority of you are from poor backgrounds so we know your plight,"Â  Mabuza said. The university was full of activity including different student commands, but a scuffle broke out between EFF and Sasco students at the TUT grounds after Sasco students forcefully removed the EFF's manifesto launch posters. The ANC regional structure condemned the acts.
