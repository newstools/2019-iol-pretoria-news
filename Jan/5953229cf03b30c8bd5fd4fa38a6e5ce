Nzimande was releasing the preliminary 2018 festive season statistics road safety report, which indicated that road fatalities had increased in all provinces except Gauteng and North West. Nzimande revealed that 1612 fatalities had been recorded, which was an increase of 16%. He said the government was concerned that young people, mostly young men who also happened to the breadwinners in their families, were losing their lives on roads. The preliminary report covers all accidents between December1 and January8. Nzimande revealed that during the festive season there were 1286 crashes that resulted in the fatalities. KwaZulu-Natal recorded the highest number of fatalities with 328, followed by the Eastern Cape with 238. Coming in third was Gauteng with 219, followed by Limpopo with 178, and then Mpumalanga with 162. The Free State recorded 159 fatalities, while the bottom three include Western Cape with 149, North West at 125 and Northern Cape with 54. A comparison of this year’s statistics with the same period last year shows that the Northern Cape, Free State and Eastern Cape recorded the highest percentage increases in fatalities. This resulted in an 80% increase in the Northern Cape from 30 to 54. The Free State increased by 28% moving from 124 fatalities in the previous year to 159 this year, while the Eastern Cape recorded a 22% increase moving from 195 fatalities to 238. “I want to look back over the past 10 years and say comprehensively what is happening, what is it that we need to do. It just can’t be the usual story, we count bodies, we count people who have been injured. Year in and year out we repeat this as if we have accepted this is a normal situation, it is not a normal situation,” said Nzimande.
