Van Damme waited on tables at Caffe Frascati for an hour while engaging with customers at the restaurant, located at Brooklyn Mall. It was here where she worked 18 years ago before going into politics. Van Damme said she wanted to encourage the government to employ young people. ““South Africa has the highest unemployment rate. Therefore you have to encourage the government to prioritise hiring our young people and giving them jobs.” Van Damme said she worked at the restaurant straight after matric and through her varsity years during holidays. “I am at the restaurant where I first got my job as a young person. I encourage business and the government to hire young people. Our youth unemployment rate is too high.” She said working there taught her a lot about good service, which she had taken with her into her political career. “Working here taught me the value of delivering good service. I understand that as a public representative, I am elected to be in service to the people of South Africa and do so with excellence.” She said it was good being at the restaurant again and encouraged students to look for employment in order to cater for their basic needs. “It felt real good. It is like riding a bicycle; you never forget. “I took orders and served customers. I engaged with some of them and they were so happy to see an MP serving them. They explained to me what issues they have as citizens.”
