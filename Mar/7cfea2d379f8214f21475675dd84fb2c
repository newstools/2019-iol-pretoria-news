Pretoria - Tshwane University of Technology students at all campuses will be seen packing their bags for home tomorrow as the university calls for students to vacate its residences. The university issued the call for residences to be emptied for the safety of students in light of the continued protest action witnessed this week. University spokesperson, Willa de Ruyter, said all campuses would remain shut until further notice. She said the decision was made by management in light of the ongoing and often volatile student protests and the university's priority of ensuring the safety of the students. "Due to the volatility and unpredictability of the current situation, the university had no choice but to close academic activities for students until further notice, in order to allow for the situation to calm down." De Ruyter said university management would continue to engage with the Department of Higher Education and Training, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and National Student Representative Council, in a bid to resolve the current situation. She also allayed fears of students falling behind, by indicating that the university would inform students of the university's recovery plan on its website in due course. "Scheduled activities of the university, including the upcoming graduation ceremonies, will continue." Pretoria News
