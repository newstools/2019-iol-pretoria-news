Pretoria - The Mojapelo family is "sick and tired” of leaking drains that flood their yard and home after heavy rains in Atteridgeville. The Mhlanga Street family has two drains in their yard that make them hate rain. For years they have been living with the problem and reporting leaks to the municipality to the extent that even sewage workers from the Department of Water and Sanitation know them well. “Every time it rains we must run home because there is a drain in our yard that’s going to leak a lot of waste from the entire Atteridgeville community. We are tired of this. We cannot live like this anymore. “We can’t do this anymore. This is a complete health hazard and it’s not good for our children who must play in this yard that’s flooded with faeces, used condoms and toilet paper. "I wonder if the municipality workers in the offices would be okay living like this,” said a hurting Magdalene Mojapelo. The family said they want the Tshwane Municipality to come and remove the drains from their yard and put them in the street. They said the municipality has done that for other people and it’s time they do the same for them. “Some neighbours have the nerve to say this is our sewage as if we are the only ones using bathrooms here. "The sewage leaks have brought us nothing but headaches. We can’t breathe in this yard. Just imagine what it's like trying to cook and eat in this yard,” she said. Pretoria News
