Beer lovers ditched their normal regalia for clothes with all shades of green. St Patrick’s revellers thought wearing green made one invisible to leprechauns and fairy creatures who would pinch anyone not wearing green. People began pinching those who didn’t wear green as a reminder that leprechauns would sneak up and pinch green-abstainers. At Capital Craft, Menlo Park, beer lovers were treated to thirst-quenching stouts on tap, Irish car bomb specials, green beer, a Guinness stew and Luck of the Irish green burgers for only a lucky few. They had a few green buns floating around. And if you ordered a burger and were lucky enough to receive one, the meal was free. Beast Johane had a ball downing his Guinness beer and said that he never missed the opportunity. While some simply stuck to the beers to celebrate the Irish day, others tried to adopt the accent after a couple of cold ones, but that didn’t go down too well. Pretoria News
