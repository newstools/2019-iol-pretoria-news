The 2019 Skytrax World Airports Awards are a measurement of customer satisfaction across airports globally. The awards are administered independently and based on surveys of passenger opinion. The Skytrax World Airport Awards began in 1999 and are based on over 100 customer nationalities participating in a passenger survey. Travellers from across the globe take part in the airport customer satisfaction survey to decide award winners. This year they received 13.73 million eligible entries from passengers across the globe. The awards focus on delivering a customer survey and an airport awards process that is independent, impartial and global. A central directive of the survey is for customers to make their own personal choices as to which airport they consider to be the best. BUSINESS REPORT ONLINE
