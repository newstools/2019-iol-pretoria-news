Once they are there, he “unifies” and gets them to introduce themselves, mingle and explore the opportunity of working together. “For this initiative, Cry is referred to as the unifier of Tshwane,” said SMU breakfast show host Percy Sleash. “He is what the Tshwane entertainment sector needs; he unites everyone.” Makallane has already united Pretoria-based Idols contestant Botlhale, musician Leon Lee, rapper Lection, Pholoso Mohlala from Isidingo, Dr Malinga's inhouse producer and friend Pontso Masote, music sensation Prince Tee and socialite Ofentse “Mawisa” Mathope, among others. Such is the life of Mabopane-based Makallane, the ON1Recordz founder and chief executive who made his name as a vocalist, writer and composer. “The company name comes from ‘all in one’; I wanted to break the boundaries and produce and promote all genres of music - from hip hop, R&B, Afro pop, house, kwaito, gospel and jazz,” he said. He broke through to the airwaves with his hit single Imbokodo, which was played on national radios. The business man has since embarked on a new journey to unite all influential individuals in Pretoria. He said his dream was to see Tshwane rise again in all aspects of life. Staff Reporter
