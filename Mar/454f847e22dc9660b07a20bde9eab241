Executive mayor Stevens Mokgalapa led at least 300 cyclists who participated in the event known as Kasi (township) Ride, hosted by the City of Tshwane. He said the main purpose of the occasion was to raise awareness about sustainable mobility and the importance of embracing cycling as an alternative means of transport. The race, now in its seventh year, was also in support of the Earth Hour initiative. Mokgalapa said: “It is part of the build-up process towards the global Earth Hour. On March 30 we are going to be switching off the lights to support the global Earth Hour initiative.” He said the City would ensure that it sustained the cycling clubs in the townships. The race was hosted in Winterveld to motivate a new cycling club in the area. Among the participants were clubs from Soweto, Mamelodi, Hammanskraal, Winterveld, Nellmapius and Soshanguve. Asked about his cycling skills, Mokgalapa said: “The last time I rode a bike it was when I was in high school. I never rode a bicycle, but I have been on a treadmill and if that is the essence of cycling, it means I can cycle.” Pretoria News
