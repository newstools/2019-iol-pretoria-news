Harry Wiggins, a mathematician at the University of Pretoria and former Survivor South Africa contestant, was crowned the 2019 South African Scrabble Champion at the weekend in Joburg. Yesterday he said the champions of the annual competition always rotated between Joburg and Cape Town. This year there were 34 players in the main section from Cape Town, Gauteng and Zambia. Wiggins and Dr Trevor Hovelmeier will be representing South Africa at the World English-speaking Scrabble Players Association Championships in Goa, India in October. He said it was an honour to be crowned champion to represent the country. “I will definitely work hard and practise as much as I can because at the world tournament I will be up against the world's best scrabble champions.” Andrew Goldberg, president of Scrabble SA, said the 2019 tournament was a great success as people came in their numbers to participate. “The aim of the tournament is to grow people's vocabulary, dictionary skills, arithmetic, spelling, strategy, composure, temperament and so much more.” Abigail Moyo Pretoria News
