He is hosting a beach party on April 6 at Smallz Lounge in Block T, Soshanguve, and all attending are required to rock up in beach outfits. Prior to the main event the Durban-born performer, producer and songwriter will be shooting a video for his hit single Siyabanika Abay’ifuni, which became a street anthem in Pretoria overnight. It is not coincidental that beach is the theme of the event; Shabangu was born in Durban and moved to Pretoria seeking better opportunities. MJ developed the love for music and performances at a very young age, singing in Sunday school as well through to his high school years. He led the choir at church at one stage and participated in most events and entertainment during his school years in KwaZulu-Natal. Whichever stage he found himself ascending to, his charismatic personality and passion for entertainment has drawn positive responses from audiences. He draws inspiration from music industry heavyweights such as Professor, Oskido and Dj Tira, who he has shared the stage with. In the capital, he has built strong musical links with Zulu Naja and Bokamoso, which gave rise to Siyabanika Abay’ifuni. - Staff Reporter Pretoria News
