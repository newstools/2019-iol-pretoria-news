Win tickets to this Friday's RnB treat as Canadian singer, songwriter and producer Tamia comes to the Sun Arena, Time Square. Tamia will present songs from her album Passion Like Fire, after which the six-time Grammy nominee will head to the Green Point A track in Cape Town on Saturday and the Botanical Gardens in Durban on Sunday. For all performances, she will be with the award-winning Lady Zamar, who will perform her hit songs such as 'Love Is Blind' and 'Collide', as well as new music. The Mamelodi-born star said: “Tamia’s music was like an anthem in South Africa, if you did not have a Tamia song then you didn't know what was hip and happening. "I'm honoured and privileged to be performing alongside her. This is a great opportunity to showcase my ability to headline alongside an international artist, at an international standard, with someone who has captured the hearts of millions.”  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that
