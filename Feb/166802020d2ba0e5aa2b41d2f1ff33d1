Back in South Africa she expressed thanks to the embassy for giving her the opportunity, as her family couldn't have afforded the cost of studying abroad. “The experience was worthwhile. I met a lot of students from different countries with unique backgrounds and cultures,” she said. “While studying for my master’s I did my internship in horticulture innovation in Guinea. This gave me enormous insights about the industry.” Since its launch, Campus France South Africa and the Embassy of France have selected and guided nearly 200 bursary holders from South Africa and Lesotho who've successfully completed their postgraduate studies in France.
