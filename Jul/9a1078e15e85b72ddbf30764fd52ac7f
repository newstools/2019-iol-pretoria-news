The 30-year-old founder of Just Helping Out said he did research and discovered that in America and Australia, donating socks to homeless and needy people was a big thing. “I found out that in a lot of countries a lot of charities go around giving socks. “I also came across this article stating that socks are actually the most needed and least donated clothing item.” Just Helping Out donated three pairs of socks to each of the 66 children at Kingdom Life Youth and Child Care Centre in Atteridgeville at the weekend. “We are still accepting more donations of gently used socks, and we’ll be donating to homeless people this Saturday. “Socks are very important. We even take single socks because we believe every person has one or two socks that have lost their pair. That’s why socks are the most needed and least donated clothing items.” People wishing to make donations can contact Mthembu at 0714247329 or inbox Just Helping Out on social media. Pretoria News
