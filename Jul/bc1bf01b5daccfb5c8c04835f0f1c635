This year the fair celebrates its centenary. The annual fair is an absolute must on the Pretoria calendar and is a firm favourite with city residents. The girls and the school community work hard to create a fun-filled family day that includes a fine craft market, mouthwatering food stalls, a funfair, toy stalls, a tombola, a pipe band, gumboot dancers, live music, a battle of the junior chefs and so much more. The book stall is particularly popular with visitors and there will be some exceptional goods up for grabs at the professional auction. The Spring Fair attracts thousands of visitors every year and with each year draws more and more people that the organisers promise not to disappoint. This year's event will be held on September 7. Entrance fees are R10 for ages 13 and younger, R20 from ages 14 and R10 for pensioners. Grade 10 pupil Lourdes de Almeida designed the official 2019 Spring Fair poster that will be used to advertise the event. Be sure to look out for her design on fliers advertising the event and on the programme on the day. Staff Reporter Pretoria News
