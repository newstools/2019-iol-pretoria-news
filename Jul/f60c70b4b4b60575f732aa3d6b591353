“We instructed an independent South African National Accreditation System - an accredited water laboratory - to conduct a random water sample in Hammanskraal. “The results indicate the water is not fit for consumption. The sample was taken on July 5, 2019, at the Hammanskraal Metro Police regional office in Region 2,” said Outa operations executive Julius Kleynhans. Outa said the community of Hammanskraal recently approached the organisation to monitor the quality of their potable water to Magalies Water Board and the City of Tshwane because of concerns over water safety. “The quality is worse than in December 2018 when the community raised the same concerns. We call on Tshwane to take urgent action,” said Kleynhans. Outa said the results also found a total viable count of 8720 CFU/ml, which was far higher than the accredited standard of <1000 CFU/ml for healthy water, which was an indicator of the presence of micro-organisms such as bacteria in the water, though no E. coli was found. Tshwane has several times said the water is safe for human consumption. - African News Agency (ANA) Pretoria News
