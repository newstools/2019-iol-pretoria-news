Pretoria - Tshwane metro police have conceded that they are a "bit overstretched" with manpower for maintaining order in the Pretoria city centre amid an ongoing protest by municipal workers over an 18%Â  pay increment. Spokesperson senior superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the City of Tshwane has asked for assistance from other law-enforcement agencies and that it is happy with the progress so far. "At this stage we are happy with the minimum resources that we have at our disposal," he said. He said that the metro police received a tip-off that protesters planned to tamper with the electricity and water supply. "We have a comprehensive plan deploying officers in all the hotsopts. "We have deployed more officers to guard municipal buildings, bus depots, resevoirs and electricity power stations." Regarding the police's plans to prevent protesters from burning dustbins in the streets, he said: "If something happens such as the burning of plastic bins our officers are mandated to respond to that." On Wednesday morning, groups of protesters were spotted blocking the roads, intersections and disrupting traffic. Their strike continued for the third day at a time when their union and the City are expected to negotiate over salary increases at the bargaining council. Meanwhile, the City have announced that it has recovered at least 40 buses, which were used to block the roads and intersections in the past two days. The City said the buses have been returned to the municipal bus depot. Pretoria News
