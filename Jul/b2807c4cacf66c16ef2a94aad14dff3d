That appears to be the plan for the South Africans as they attempt to reach the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) tonight at Cairo International Stadium at the expense of their perennial rivals, the Super Eagles. The Nigeria camp have spoken about the threat Bafana pose with their speedy attacks, which were on full display in the 1-0 win over Egypt. Nigeria will try to counter that with their strength in what should be an entertaining contest between speed and muscle. “South Africans are naturally mobile and they are good with the ball at their feet,” Bafana coach Stuart Baxter said. “Usually they express themselves and play off the cuff. “We are trying very hard to get that balance between being well-organised and not inhibiting their attack. We will keep working on that. “We are nowhere near the finished article. That’s why we have to remain humble.” Both teams will come into this match confident after morale-boosting wins. Bafana beat hosts Egypt in the last 16 while Nigeria edged past Cameroon, holders of the Afcon which they won in Gabon two years ago. Pretoria News
