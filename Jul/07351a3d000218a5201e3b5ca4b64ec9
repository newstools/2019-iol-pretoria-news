Pretoria - The Pretoria CBD is gridlocked again today with buses still blocking some major intersections. The protest seems to have intensified since yesterday as union members who want an 18% salary increase are trying to drive their point home. Frustrated motorists are using some narrow side streets and others are driving along the pavement to get to their destinations. Buses are at more intersections than yesterday and the metro cops and pointsmen seem overwhelmed by the task of directing and redirecting the morning flow of commuters.
