PPC Cement felt it was important to look beyond big companies that buy cement bags in bulk, and invest money and resources in uplifting and empowering individuals willing to put in the work to learn to make strong quality bricks. The company held a brick-making workshop in Kagisanong View and brought together 32 local brick makers to learn about the right processes needed to make solid hard bricks that can be approved by lab technicians. Most of these men had been making bricks for some time and some were even popular as brick-makers, but PPC wanted to jack up their game a notch. They learnt to make solid hard bricks, without using fancy machines, but by just following specifications that were also followed by industry leaders. Gavin Gouws, PPC area manager in local enterprise development, said the company had already conducted about 10 brick-making workshops in Gauteng. He said the project was about empowering brick-makers and investing in township people and communities. Pretoria News
