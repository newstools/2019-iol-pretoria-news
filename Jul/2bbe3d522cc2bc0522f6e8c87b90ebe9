Pretoria - The launch of a multimillion rand new fleet of 329 vehicles in the City of Tshwane is a step in the right direction to respond quickly to service delivery complaints. This was said by mayor Stevens Mokgalapa during a ceremony to hand over the vehicles, valued at R118 million, to a fleet workshop in the city centre. He said the procurement was noteworthy for improving the current administration's promise to accelerate service delivery to residents. "The asset to the city was approved by council at a cost of R118 million. "This transaction was facilitated by a Department of National Treasury-regulated contract with Toyota, Nissan and UD trucks," Mokgalapa said. The fleet of 329 was comprised of sedans, double cab and single cab vans, minibuses and armoured trucks. The fleet will be allocated to the Tshwane Metro Police Department, Group Financial Services, Utility Services, Environment and Agriculture Management and Economic Development and Spatial Planning. Mokgalapa said the allocation meant that the city was more equipped to address departmental needs in carrying out their service delivery mandate. "This mandate extends to increasing this particular capacity with a 100% city-owned fleet which is a deviation from unmanageable leases that disadvantaged the city’s operational duties with financial prudence," he said.
