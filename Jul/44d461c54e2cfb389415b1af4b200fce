This is according to Atteridgeville youngsters, who combined their love for the brand with doing good deeds for those in need. Seeking to break the stigma, six youngsters started a GTI Sanitary Pads Drive to help young girls in need. “With sanitary pads there is no such as thing as you have enough or you don’t need them any more. The need for them will be there as long as we are humans,” said chairperson Lebo Sathekge. “You’ll be surprised by the large number of women who find themselves stressed, thinking that the time has come, but they don’t know what they are going to do.” They would welcome others to join their drive irrespective of the cars that they drive. “Doing good is not about the car you drive. We welcome everyone, including people who don’t drive. This started as an initiative to show people that young GTI drivers are also good people who love doing good,” he said. Pretoria News
