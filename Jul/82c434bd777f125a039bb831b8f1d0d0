Further, the survey indicated that only 49% cited it as their first choice for a career. The findings were announced yesterday by Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga during the release of the report at Nellmapius Secondary School in Pretoria. The findings were gleaned from about 260 000 teachers in 15 000 schools across 48 countries and economies. The report surveyed teachers and school leaders on the working conditions and the learning environment in several countries, including Australia, Japan, Korea, Norway, the US and UK, to provide a barometer of the profession. The report is viewed as an examination of the basic education sector from the perspective of the teachers. The report also revealed that 60% of teachers are female and only 20% of them are principals. In South Africa, 69% of teachers report having participated in some kind of formal or informal induction when they joined their current school, compared with 42% of teachers across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries and economies participating in the report.
