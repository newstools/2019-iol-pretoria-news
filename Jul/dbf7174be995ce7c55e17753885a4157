JOHANNESBURG -Â About 60 workers on the expanded public works programme (EPWP) at Kalafong hospital in Pretoria have complained about picking up illnesses due to not being vaccinated beforehand like regular employees, the Democratic Alliance's shadow member of the executive council for health Jack Bloom said on Monday. The EPWP workers, who have been employed at the hospital since February 2018 as cleaners, general workers and kitchen staff, say they have spoken to management and officials at the department of infrastructure development (DID) which runs the programme, but were brushed aside and threatened, Bloom said in a statement. "It seems that they were never vaccinated because they came from DID instead of being employed directly by the hospital," he said. "This oversight has affected their health, leading to frequent work absences." Bloom said he had referred the issue to the South African Human Rights Commission as the the workers right to work in a safe environment had been violated. African News Agency (ANA)
