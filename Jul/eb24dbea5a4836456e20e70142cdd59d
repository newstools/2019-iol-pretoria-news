Pretoria - The City of Tshwane has warned that bus commuters are bound to be left stranded as the result of the ongoing strike by workers affiliated to the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu). Roads and Transport MMC, Sheila Senkubuge, said the City has suspended A Re Yeng and Tshwane Bus Services operations after some of their operational routes were blocked by striking bus drivers from Tshwane Bus Services. She said that other municipal vehicles, such as trucks and tractors were used to block roads. Senkubuge said “This is just opportunistic behaviour. The illegal movements of City property, vandalism and actions that disrupt service delivery will not be tolerated.” She added that “everyone involved would face disciplinary action”. She apologised to all commuters for the inconvenience caused by the strike. "The City thanks passengers for their continued support and would like to assure them that we are continually looking at ways of improving our service. "The Roads and Transport Department will keep Tshwane residents updated on developments via the various communication platforms," Senkubuge said Pretoria News
