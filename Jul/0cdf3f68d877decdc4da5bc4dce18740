Tebogo Mpufane of the Kopano Manyano God the Founder Centre for the Homeless said visiting charity organisations for 67 minutes and then disappearing was a “band-aid solution”. He said “67 minutes is not a true reflection of (Nelson Mandela's) legacy”. “We are calling on South Africa to continue the legacy of Mandela beyond July 18, because South Africa needs more than 67 minutes on one day,” he said. Desiree Fisher, chairperson of the Concerned Parents Association of Eersterust,believed 67 minutes were a starting point and not necessarily useless. She said generally South Africans believed in group-think, and this was a positive thing for people to embark on. “Look, 67 minutes is not enough but it does in fact make a difference. Think of it a bit like Christmas, it only comes once a year, but when it does it is magical,” she said. Even the Nelson Mandela Foundation has slightly changed its tune from 67 minutes to Mandela Day: the Next Chapter. Spokesperson Luzuko Koti said the new Mandela Day strategy would primarily encourage collaborative partnerships to support initiatives in the areas of education and literacy, food and nutrition, sanitation, shelter as well as active citizenship.
