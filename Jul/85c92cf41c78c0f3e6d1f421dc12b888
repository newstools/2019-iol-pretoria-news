The gesture was just one of the many activities that took place around the city to celebrate International Mandela Day. MMCs also visited other parts of the city handing out blankets, cleaning and painting homes. At Steve Biko, Sheagon Matle, 10, chose a brown teddy saying it was her favourite colour. Her father Godfrey Matle said he was happy that his daughter received a gift on the day. “I'm very happy that my daughter is one of the people who received gifts because she will have a great day just like any other person who received gifts on this day.” Acting speaker Zweli Khumalo said they merely wanted to put a smile on the children's faces. “It's not much, but if it could bring a smile to the kids that are here and make them feel at home. We thought we should come and make their day and at least for a moment they should forget about why they are here.” He said other staff members who could not knit donated financially towards buying the materials. “The theme has always been the same but this year we decided to be more involved in the making of the gifts unlike the previous years.” Pretoria News
