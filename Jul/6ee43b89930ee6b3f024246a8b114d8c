Police spokesperson Captain Steve Malatji said a fight was allegedly started by a paramedic belonging to the other service. “Apparently a member from the crew of [another service] started to shout at the guys who were helping the injured; they ignored him and kept doing their job. He got frustrated and enraged by their [ignoring him] he insulted them,” Malatji said. The incident occurred on the R55 on Monday. The two ambulance providers had been summoned to the scene of an accident, which involved several vehicles. Emer-G-Med said it had dispatched an advanced life-support unit primary-care ambulance and a paramedic team who on arrival at the scene treated several injured patients. “While one of our intermediate life-support members was treating the injured, he was viciously assaulted by an ambulance driver of a small ambulance service. “Our advanced life-support paramedic intervened, removed our member out of harm’s way and continued rendering emergency care to the injured,” Emer-G-Med said. The injured medic, who has not been identified, was taken to hospital after the “unprovoked” attack. Emer-G-Med rejected a claim that its employee had stabbed the ambulance worker. “Our member - who was the victim of an unprovoked and deliberate attack - was taken to hospital and treated for facial lacerations and a ruptured eardrum. He is also undergoing trauma counselling,” Emer-G-Med said. Pretoria News
