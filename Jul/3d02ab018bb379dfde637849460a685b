The two-hour showcase of her music is part of the Vavasati International Women’s Festival, which will feature 27 works strictly created by women. The festival, in its seventh edition, will leave art lovers spoilt for choice, as showcases include music, poetry, dance, drama and visual art. The festival’s name Vavasati - Xitsonga for “women” - reiterates the power and strength women possess when they stand united, and references the 1958 women’s march. The 32-year-old will be accompanied by the University of Johannesburg female choir Azani. The concert, which will take place on August 23, is part of a tour of her solo music and will start at 7:30pm. Mda announced in March that she had taken the plunge to pursue a solo career, but made it clear that she had no intention of leaving the acapella group. Tickets are available at Webtickets online or at any pick * pay store for R100. RUDZANI MATSHILI Pretoria News
