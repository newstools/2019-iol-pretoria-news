Bushiri is now ranked the most popular prophet in the continent, with more than 3.7million followers on Facebook, according to a survey conducted by Malawi 24 News. Whatever your reason for following him is, his Facebook page created in March 2011 has become one of the fastest growing on the social media platform. He is followed by Nigerian TBJoshua of The Synagogue Church of All Nations with more than 3.5million followers. Last week, the flamboyant prophet was thrust into the spotlight again after claiming that God visited his ministry about three weeks ago. In a Youtube video, Bushiri is seen calling for wind and fire. And then, as congregants tremble and collapse in awe, he shouts: “See the Holy Spirit”. A strong wind leaps out of nowhere followed by a whirlwind of yellow dust. He received flak from fellow prophets and pastors for claiming that the wind was indeed God. But the criticism was just one of many as Bushiri does not seem to stay out of trouble. Bushiri and his wife Mary are out on bail for fraud and money laundering. Pretoria News
