And to prove just that, RussellStone Treasury, a financial and investment company, donated 138 calculators to Bokgoni Technical Secondary School in Atteridgeville yesterday. According to the head of treasury at the company, Ryan Booysen, the calculators were one less thing for learners to worry about in the already difficult subject. With six years in the game, the company hopes it will touch more lives. “It’s amazing what a small object like a calculator can do to assist in the journey of a learner,” he said. Booysen, a maths enthusiast, said bigger than just donating a calculators was that they were forging a relationship with the school. The school focuses on maths, technical drawing, welding, bricklaying and plastering. It has been acknowledged as the best in its district (Tshwane South) for producing the best matric results. Principal George Sono said: “It’s a gesture that the school will really treasure.” He said they believed that maths was a necessary enabler in the development of conceptual understanding, problem-solving skills, reasoning skills and the ability to apply knowledge in new situations. The school is no stranger to the spotlight, its principal having received the Best Principal award on two occasions. Pretoria News
