As part of the programme, members of the public will be granted free entry to museums from May 16 to 25. For more than 40 years, International Museum Day has been organised by the International Council of Museums. On the day, participating museums plan creative events and activities, engage with the public and highlight the importance of the role of museums as institutions that serve society. Themed “Museums as cultural hubs: the future of tradition”, this year’s focus is on the new role of museums as active participants in communities. “The aim is to create awareness among community members, teach them about the existence of museums around them as well as to showcase our rich history since we are custodians of heritage,” said Tebogo Kgari, public programmes specialist at Ditsong Museums of SA. “The youth are the leaders of tomorrow, so it’s very important to empower them with our rich heritage. We are also trying to show them the importance of our museums, traditions and the reason why museums exist.” Kgari said it was sad to see people not utilising museums to full capacity, reflected by the declining numbers of Africans visiting museums. “I encourage our counterparts to use us and the services we provide in order for them to get more information on anything they want to learn. We are not here to give information only, but we would love to get feedback from people on their expectations with regards to our exhibitions and relevancy.” There will be a co-ordinated dialogue between youth and adults on this year’s theme on Friday at Ditsong National Museum of Cultural History from 10am.
