In this regard, the City of Tshwane said it was working hard to put its best foot forward when guests, including heads of states and representatives of BRICS countries, diplomats and the public converged for the occasion. City spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said they had been cleaning, fixing roads and repainting road markings. “We can safely say we are going overboard to ensure the capital is in tip-top shape for the occasion. “We don’t want to paint a picture that we are doing this because of the inauguration. “However, we are going overboard because this is the capital and we have ambassadors and heads of states coming into the country,” he said. Mashigo appealed to road users to be patient during to a planned dry run. By this past Friday, construction of the main stage at the stadium and other facilities for the event had begun. Loftus operations manager Hugo Kemp symbolically handed over the stadium keys to the presidential ­inauguration inter-ministerial committee. From 3pm on Friday to 10pm on Saturday, the entire area will be closed to the public. Among streets affected are around Rietondale Park, which will be a park-and-ride facility for invited guests, as well as Hatfield and Loftus Park. Roads affected include Soutpansberg, Government Avenue, Eastwood Street, Gordon, Francis Baard, University and Lynnwood roads and Walton Jameson. Pretoria News
