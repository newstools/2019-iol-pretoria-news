Named the Ifreecan, he says it is inspired by his past - in particular the cultural heritage of his grandparents. He creates the watch with a bamboo or wooden face which can be personalised with a picture of a popular icon such as of Nelson Mandela, or of the wearer’s own face or that of a loved one. Straps are leather - including Nguni hide - or one can choose from colourful African bands and embellishments like feathers. Lisonga, 27, said his grandmother used to make watch straps and belts with leather and beads. His late grandfather left him a leather wallet made of python skin. “When I inherited the wallet in 2016, a conversation with my grandmother about evolving the family legacy inspired me to start making my own products.” “Our hand-crafted and hand-stitched products are a family heirloom, passed down,” he said. They are available at a store in Newtown, Joburg, called Homeground Shandis, or online: www.ifreecan-time.co.za. Most of his customers are young, and love that the watch has a traditional yet popular feel. “It’s big as a wedding gift. And we recently sold four watches to China after a lady had seen my work on social media.” He is using his brand to help create employment opportunities for others. Pretoria News
