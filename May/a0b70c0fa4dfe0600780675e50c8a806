Pretoria - Representatives of AfriForum today submitted protest letters to the Provincial Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), against the transportation of people to the presidential inauguration.

De Klerk mentioned that the protest letters were accepted by Zodwa Modipane, executive assistant to the Director General at Cogta “As AfriForum we have also sent a letter to the presidency in this regard to withdraw its request and we urge Cogta to refuse the presidency’s request, as the money to transport 18 000 people could be better spent to pay for basic needs of citizens,” De klerk said.
