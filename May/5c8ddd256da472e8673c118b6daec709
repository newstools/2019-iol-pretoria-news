Pretoria - The City of Tshwane shut down a portion of Madiba Street in the city centre to unveil a fleet of 72 new emergency vehicles and launch a toll-free number for its residents. Executive mayor Stevens Mokgalapa said the bright new vehicles were part of the City’s strategic emergency service fleet replacement programme. Speaking outside Tshwane House where the vehicles were parked, Mokgalapa said he was happy that these vehicles had state-of-the-art equipment and the latest professional tools on the market. These vehicles include 18 rapid intervention vehicles, four bush pumpers (fire engines), 14 engine pumpers (fire engines), one hazardous material unit, one mobile command unit and 34 ambulances. “We are quite pleased with the new modern fleet of vehicles. "Of more significant, this fleet will enable us to ensure sustainable emergency service delivery to all residents and stakeholders in our capital city. Spectators were pleased to learn that Tshwane would use the three digit number, 107, to dial for emergency assistance from a Telkom landline or mobile network. Mokgalapa said having vehicles was one thing but having a special emergency services number is fantastic and a matter of ensuring that they were accessible to residents who needed them. “We often hear of horrendous stories of lives lost due to delays in the response time of ambulances. And this is meant to curb such tragic stories. "This number aims to ensure that there is a quick access to emergency response.” Pretoria News
