The workers, mostly cleaners, porters, household staff and clerks, said they were not being considered for permanent posts. The workers said they were sent for development training with an understanding they would be considered for posts. “Our issue is that posts get advertised, but we are amazed when people from outside are hired. How do they choose those people over us because we were trained by them. “We feel abused because if the hospital says we must be developed and trained, why is it that we do not get permanent jobs?” a worker said. “Do they want to see unemployment rotate. We were trained here, so we expect jobs.” The group said they saw no need for managers to look for people outside while they were available and experienced. “It's painful that I get R2600 a month and then a person gets hired without experience and I am forced to train that person for the job with more money,” another disgruntled staff member said. Kalafong chief executive Dr Manei Letebele said the hospital did not have a contract with the workers, who were contracted elsewhere. “The understanding is that they be considered when posts are available, but recruitment requirements are followed. "The recent appointments did consider the programme when appointing staff.” Pretoria News
