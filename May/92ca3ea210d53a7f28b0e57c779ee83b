The day, known in Norway as syttende mai (May 17), is a national holiday dedicated to the signing of the constitution in 1814 which declared Norway to be an independent kingdom from Sweden. It is one of the oldest constitutions in the world, and was very dear to the country and its people, said Helle. With its liberal values and emphasis on equality, it has helped to form the modern Norway, one of the most prosperous countries in the world with a high level of equality. But, Helle said, a high GDP per capita and low unemployment were not the only indicator of a country’s well-being; Norway topped the UN human development index and has been rated the second happiest country, after Finland. The event at the County Club, Waterkloof, featured a display of Norway’s loyal and generous support for the liberation Struggle in South Africa. Last year, Norway’s Prime Minister Erna Solberg visited South Africa, and President Cyril Ramaphosa will be the keynote speaker at the Nordic African Business Summit in October. Guests enjoyed Norwegian fare, including a seafood fest prepared by chef Gunnar Jensen. Val Boje Pretoria News
