Pretoria - Elderly braved the chilly weather on Wednesday morning to cast their vote at Moretele Primary School in Mamelodi West this morning.  Voters started trickling in from about 8am, with the elderly having their own special queues. Dressed in doeks and blankets they spoke among themselves while they waited.  Emma Bogoshi, 82, said this was probably her last election and she was doing it for her grandchildren. “It want them to have ample opportunities and jobs so they can sustain their families,” she said.  She also urged young people to vote with their heads and not hearts like they previously did. “Today the youth have lots of information to make informed decisions. There’s books, technology etc, they must make informed decisions,” she said.  Electoral Commission officials at the polling station were all smiles as residents arrived to cast their votes.
