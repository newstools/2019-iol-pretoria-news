Afterwards, Bridgett Nzimande, a Grade 12 learner at Soshanguve High School, said: “I’ve learnt that if you want to be a nurse, you need to have passion and compassion. I found out about the different categories in the nursing field and I’ll apply at the different institutions and specialise in midwifery as it’s to do with babies.” Her classmate Oratile Moshidiadded: “The theatre at the hospital has a machine which shows how they insert a camera inside the human body to see where pain originates. “Nursing as a career is about compassion and care. I’ve learnt so much today.” The hospital’s Khathu Ledwaba said Nurses Day was about recognising the quality care given to patients daily. “We’re promoting nursing as a career because the younger generation don’t have the insight into what nursing entails.” Ledwaba said the day had assisted the young adults to realise that nursing was not just a job but a calling. “One must be passionate, humble, and treat patients with dignity, kindness, respect and compassion.” Another official, Petunia Kabongo, said the day was also about providing career guidance to the community. “Nursing is a noble profession, and this is a month dedicated to us as nurses, and it was amazing to celebrate with the members of the community.” Staff Reporter Pretoria News
