Pretoria - Voting at near an old farm school in Centurion was delayed by almost 40 minutes as the IEC officials waited for the election forms to be delivered. The station is where Premier David Makhura was expected to cast his vote. At least 100 people braved the chilly weather to join the queue at 6:30 am. They patiently waited for the election process to get under way. Voters expressed excitement to be part of more than 22 million South Africans to take part in the polls. One of them Michael Hamps said he joined the queue at 6::40 am. "I am feeling wonderful. It is an absolute privilege to be able to make a cross and you know that it is only if you have participated that you can say something afterwards. If you don't vote, keep quiet," he said. Despite the fact that the voting process didn't kick off at 7 am, he was happy that the station opened on time. "We are going into the polling station very soon and let the best team win," he said. Another voter Mike Sigambo said he felt very happy to be part of the electorates in the 2019 general elections. "I am hoping that everything goes well as planned for today," he said. Pretoria News
