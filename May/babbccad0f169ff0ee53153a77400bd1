He was last seen on April 20 at about 2pm. Yesterday his mother Gladys Bankoes said: “Tiro is an automotive mechanic. On the day of his disappearance he drove a silver grey VW polo hatchback, registration VPM 048 GP. He told us he was going to buy car parts in Gezina.” The upset mom added: “He is not into shady things, therefore, we lent him the family car. He always communicated if he'd be home late. If his phone was about to go off he'd give us an alternative number. But since that day we've heard nothing from him.” Tiro’s father Cornelius Bankoes said a missing person case was initially opened at Pretoria North police station. “Police dragged their feet and then the case was referred to Akasia police station, which also didn't do justice to it. We've started searching in hospitals, at friends and police stations. But no luck yet,” he said. Tiro’s mother said that two weeks before her son went missing, a friend in police custody called him to testify they were together on the day the daughter of a feared Nigerian man was allegedly raped. "We fear our son’s testimony may be why he went missing." Anyone with information can call his parents on 073 781 0966 or 082 903 6302, or report it to police. Pretoria News
