“The SANDF can confirm that the member received medical attention at the stadium and was released. The reports on social media platforms that the member is in the intensive care unit are not true,” said Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobozi. “The SANDF once again would like to caution the public not to spread incorrect and irresponsible information.” Mgobozi said the SANDF was concerned about the inaccurate reports being peddled around the incident. Paratroopers were part of the major military displays during the swearing-in ceremony, presided over by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, at Loftus Versfeld. The event was attended by thousands of South Africans and foreign delegates, including several heads of state and government. As the paratrooper descended onto the pitch, directing his parachute, he crashed into a soft-shell mortar launcher, sparking gasps from the terraces. The video of the incident has been widely shared on social media platforms, particularly on Twitter and Facebook, and in many instances caused hot debates about the capabilities of the SANDF members. Massive military displays and spectacular aircraft formations mesmerised the thousands of people who had come from various provinces and nations to witness Ramaphosa’s inauguration. - African News Agency (ANA) Pretoria News
