Using the Tshwane Bus Service to ferry the people, the park-and-ride service started operating from 3am. The buses transported the public as well as media to Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool to get accreditation. Up to 200 other buses brought in people from other parts of Gauteng and neighbouring provinces. However, after proceedings had been concluded, people stood in long queues while waiting to be transported back to the Tshwane Events Centre. “There were no problems in the morning, but it is a different story now. I’m tired and as you can see I came with my two children and we still have to go back home to Limpopo,” a mother said. Peter Orapelang from Sunnyside said: “I left my car at the Tshwane Events Centre, but I think I’ll have to walk to my flat and fetch the car later."
