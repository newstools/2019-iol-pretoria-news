SA Weather Service senior forecaster Puseletso Mofokeng said: “Average temperatures are going to be warmer than normal this winter - around 22°C to 23°C. “This is because El Niño will continue to strengthen throughout winter, hence both minimum and maximum temperatures will be higher than normal. “This doesn’t mean we won’t have a system that would cause cold temperatures, but generally temperatures will be warmer than normal.” El Niño is a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. It’s described as the “warm phase” of a larger phenomenon, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, and happens when the sea water temperature rises in surface waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Mofokeng said there was no chance of rain leading into the weekend in Pretoria and Gauteng. However, residents could expect cool conditions, but the temperature would get warmer from Saturday going into next week. Mornings and evenings would then remain cool, but days would be warm - around 24°C to 26°C. Virgilatte Gwangwa Pretoria News
