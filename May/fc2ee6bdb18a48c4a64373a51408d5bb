“Our people have spoken and have done this clearly and empathetically. All of us are called on to respect the word of our people,” Ramaphosa said at the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) results centre in Pretoria. “We can declare with certainty that democracy has emerged victorious in our country.” Freedom and democracy should reign, he said, thanking all South Africans and stakeholders for making the elections peaceful. Political parties had conducted themselves well, although there was a intense rivalry, he said. The Home Affairs Department was to be thanked for issuing temporary identity documents to ensure people could vote. Ramaphosa thanked the SAPS, security companies and the IEC staff. Joking with the media, Ramaphosa granted presidential permission to sleep for a “number of weeks”. After Ramaphosa had spoken, IEC chairman Glen Mashinini declared the elections free and fair.
