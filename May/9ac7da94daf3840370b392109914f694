“Promise like a Politician” trended on social media as South Africans poked fun at political parties which promised free education, jobs and land expropriation, among other things, in trying to secure votes. Corporates climbed on the bandwagon, using the poll to promote special offers and advertise their products. Apart from Wimpy’s free coffee for voters on Wednesday, Nando’s, which is known for its cheeky ads, said: “Our democracy isn’t having a quarter life crisis, it’s just getting started. “Show us your voter’s thumb and get your quarter chicken, chips and roll for only R25”. Checkers offered its customers a “voters (boerewors) roll”. Humorous memes spread across the internet, such as the one suggesting there should only be two parties - on Friday and Saturday evenings. Sadly, though, there were those who defaced posters. IEC chief electoral officer Sy Mamabolo reminded that this was a criminal offence. Meanwhile, City of Tshwane spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said that now that the elections were done and dusted, the posters must be taken down. Parties had 14 days from the release of results within which to remove their posters. Sakhile Ndlazi Pretoria News
