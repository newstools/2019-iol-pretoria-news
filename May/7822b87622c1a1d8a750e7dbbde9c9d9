Two triumphant still lifes by Irma Stern lead a strong selection of paintings by important post-war artists Walter Battiss, Christo Coetzee, Erik Laubscher and Alexis Preller on offer at Strauss & Co’s forthcoming Johannesburg sale on Monday, 20 May. Susie Goodman, an executive director at Strauss & Co, says: “Earlier twentieth South African paintings have been a bedrock of the Strauss & Co offering since its first auction in March 2009, and no artist better represents the durable performance of this group of artists at auction than Irma Stern. She is Strauss & Co’s top-selling artist at auction, having grossed R420.5 million from 175 lots sold since 2009. Her still lifes continue to command a premium at auction and I am especially delighted with the two magnificent floral studies that form part of the upcoming sale.” Both these still lifes originate from the painter’s high-water period of the 1930s and 40s. Painted a year after Stern’s second visit to Zanzibar in 1945, Still Life with Fruit and Dahlias (estimate R12 – 15 million) portrays a multicoloured bouquet of dahlias in a partially glazed Chinese martaban jar flanked by two bowls of fruit on Zanzibari woven mats and two sliced papayas, and is presented in its original Zanzibari frame featuring carved flower motifs. The work reveals Stern’s innovative use of colour and brush technique. “At once a dramatic and captivating assertion of Stern’s unchallenged mastery of expressive form and an unapologetic celebration of exoticism and sensuality, it is unsurprising that this painting set a record for the highest price paid to that point for a twentieth-century South African artwork when it last appeared on auction in 1999,” says art historian Professor Federico Freschi, who is Executive Dean of the Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture at the University of Johannesburg.     Still Life with Basket of Flowers (estimate R4.5 – 6 million) is an earlier work, from 1937, and shows Stern’s still recent and fervent embrace of an exciting colour palette that include splashes of red, pink, purple and orange in her description of the zinnias. Strauss & Co is offering ten Stern lots. Other highlights from the May catalogue include a 1962 portrait of an anonymous Malay Woman (estimate R2 – 3 million) wearing a pink headscarf and cerise dress. The work forms part of a consignment from the estate of the late Sonia Lapin (née Kalmanson), a New Yorker who settled in Johannesburg.
