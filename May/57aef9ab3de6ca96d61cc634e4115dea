Pretoria - With the election day in full swing, some coloured people in Eersterust are confused as to which political parties they will vote for. Ashwin van Schalkwyk, who was championing Patricia De Lille’s Good Party, said most coloureds were stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to which political party to vote for. He says the DA ruling in Eersterust is no different to how the ANC rules in other parts of South Africa. He says he thinks that the majority of coloured people voting for the DA across Eersterust are motivated by the anti-black racism rather than genuinely happy with the DA. He says the ANC disappointed the coloured people when they came into power and forgot about the coloured people.

The presiding officer said they were expecting people to come in droves around 4pm. Pretoria News
