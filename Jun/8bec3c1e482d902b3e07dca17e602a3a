It was after traders appealed the May 31 high court judgment that they must make way for the mall construction. The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, yesterday postponed the matter to allow respondents to file answering affidavits. Respondents were the City of Tshwane and developers of Tshwane Regional Mall - Isibonelo Property Services and Interden Management Services. Traders’ representatives Lawyers for Human Rights appealed after the ruling that hawkers must vacate the trading space near Denneboom train station. They challenged the ruling on the grounds “the judge erred by ordering informal traders to relocate to a temporary trading site within 48 hours”. They said the judgment failed to take into account the affected traders were not 29, as stated by developers - they were 170. In court papers they cited the developers failed to comply with the court order dated February 10, 2017, that they ought to provide alternative trading space for hawkers. Their case also hinged on the fact that the judge overlooked that the trading site where he wanted traders to relocate was dangerous and not viable for business. Developers, on the other hand, said they urgently needed the space occupied by traders to complete the mall construction in August. Pretoria News
