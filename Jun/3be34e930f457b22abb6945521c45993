On entering the gates of the school that’s strong on maintaining its tradition, the visitors were greeted by the sights and sounds of Scotland, with vivid-coloured tartans, skirling bagpipes, hypnotic drums and Highland dancing. The day’s activities included a Celtic market and ended with the ever-popular massed bands march. Vice-president of the Pipe Bands Association of South Africa Rory Bellingan said the annual event at the school was one of three national competition events for pipe bands, the others being in Benoni and on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast. “We have bands here from all over the country,” he said, with participants vying for top spot but also entertaining the crowd. “Our bands are split into different grades, from school band level right up to seniors. We embrace the Scottish pipe band tradition because that’s where it originated, and it’s something we love doing,” he said. Pretoria News
