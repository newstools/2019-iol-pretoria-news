Gauteng - There are some things you may not send by airmail. Following the airlines tightening up on passengersâ€™ transport of batteries and liquids, the SA Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has tightened regulations regarding the transport of such items by air cargo. Not allowed in mail bags which will be transported by plane are liquids, creams and lotions and items with lithium batteries. Bags will be scanned and if banned items are found, these will be returned to sender. According to the automaker, substances which are capable of posing a risk to health, safety, property or the environment are part of the list of dangerous goods. This prompted the SA Post Office to send notifications to their customers to not try to post items that are on the list which includes, poison, liquid, drugs, animals, biological material, living organisms, explosive items, precious stones and metal, fur, porn, lithium batteries, as well as creams. Uninsured jewellery, precious stones or precious metals should also not be dispatched by air mail. Spokesperson Johan Kruger said the stricter rules were made to ensure the safety of aircraft.
