This followed Eskom’s 123 kilovolt power supply line trip at Njala substation yesterday morning. The substation supplies power to a big part of Pretoria East and other areas. An efficient and dedicated team of technicians managed to swiftly restore the power supply to the majority of the areas that were affected by the power failure. However, some of the city’s services and systems are still affected. This includes the server system that the city’s customer care contact centres use to interact with customers. The customers have been unable to call in or email their queries through since Tuesday. The city has apologised for the unanticipated occurrence and it is hoped that the system will be in working order soon. The SMS line designated for reporting power failures is not affected by this glitch. Residents can still report power failures by sending an SMS with the word power followed by the account number and a short message at 082 612 0333. Pretoria News
