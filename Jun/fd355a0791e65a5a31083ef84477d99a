Mayoral spokesperson Norman Mohale, however, said the report will not be made public yet because it was still under the scrutiny of the City's legal department. “The investigation is concluded. The report is back. It is sitting with the legal department for their opinion. From there we can announce its content,” Mohale said. He was tight-lipped about the parties implicated in the report and the persons responsible for investigation, except to say it was conducted internally. “Once I get into who conducted the investigation, it would compromise the mayor,” he said. The probe was launched after it emerged that a high-level delegation was about to fly to China. City manager Dr Moeketsi Mosola had allegedly sanctioned the trip despite being authorised not to do so. At the time, Mokgalapa said he discovered that Mosola “erroneously” signed a document to authorise the expedition on behalf of the mayor. Officials were scheduled to attend a C40 Cities conference in China and participate in deliberations on climate change. The trip was called off because Mosola allegedly signed the documents authorising the trip twice on different dates - for himself and the mayor. Pretoria News
