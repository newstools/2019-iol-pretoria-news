“From January to April the figures reflect strong growth in domestic tourism, when compared to last year,” SA Tourism said yesterday. Domestic holiday trips rose by 59.7% - highlighting one of SA Tourism’s objectives to make locals travel more. “SA Tourism has been focusing on campaigns to entice South Africans to tour their country. “We are noting the impact of our marketing efforts In the first quarter (January to March), 18.4% of South Africans mentioned not having a reason to travel, an improvement from 20.5% in 2018,” acting chief executive Sthembiso Dlamini said. Overall, total domestic trips grew by 11% from January to April, an indication of the growth in domestic tourism. Despite a strong showing in April, where growth was recorded from major international source markets like the UK and Germany, the cumulative four-month total reflects an overall decline of 1.3%, compared to the same period last year.
