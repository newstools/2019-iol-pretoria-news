Lucas van Heerden and his employee, France Dikgale, were held for apparently manufacturing steroids illegally at a farmhouse in Hammanskraal. At their last appearance last month, Van Heerden, 53, was granted bail of R30 000, while his 38-year-old co-accused was granted R10 000 bail. Both men face charges of manufacturing medicine illegally, in terms of the Medicine and Related Substances Act. Van Heerden was also charged with the illegal possession of firearms. Both men pleaded not guilty to all the charges. The pair were arrested after officers found drugs and firearms in what appeared to be a normal family home owned by a registered pharmacist in the area. The police, using their K9 unit and the Flying Squad, went to the house on a plot to find a garage with a drug-making machine. The machine produced steroid tablets, while a microwave in the kitchen stored glass vials to keep them sterilised, it is alleged. NPA spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane yesterday said the matter was postponed as the State awaited lab results. “The State is awaiting lab results, because they have to find out that whatever they had seized were indeed illegal substances.” The men are due back in court on September 26.
