So intense is the dispute that police in Mamelodi East have initiated an investigation after the windows of several houses in Extension 6 were damaged during a scuffle last week. It started after Extension 6 residents took a stand and protected the electricity transformer and pole in Monamane Street, where Phomolong dwellers connected electricity illegally. The pole was pushed out of its hole during the scuffle. Community leaders Patricia Ringane, Joyce Matlou, David Silulu and Jan Soane of Extension 6 said Phomolong residents were aggressive in their attempts to steal electricity. “Since these people started stealing electricity in our community, we've always had power interruptions. We struggle to cook or boil water because there's just too much load for the transformer to support. “Worst of all, the man who connected the wires for Phomolong residents has threatened us,” said Ringane. Ward councillor Shadi Maja said: “I understand what the people of Phomolong have been doing is wrong and I want the police to punish the culprits. I'm focussed on getting the municipality to come and put up this pole because it's dangerous.” Mamelodi East police said they were investigating. Pretoria News
