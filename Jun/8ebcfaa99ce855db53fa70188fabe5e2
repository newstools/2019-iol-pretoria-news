This will be her first outing over the distance since she launched a legal battle against new rules targeting athletes with hyperandrogenism. It is also her first race over 800m since winning gold at the Diamond League in Doha on May 4. She was originally going to run the 3000m in the US, but requested to run the 800m - her favourite distance for which she has won two Olympic golds. Semenya was cleared to compete in the event after Switzerland’s top court upheld her appeal against an IAAF ruling obliging women with higher than normal male hormone levels to artificially lower their testosterone, before competing in races at distances of 400m to the mile. An initial appeal by Semenya was struck down by the Court for Arbitration of Sport in Lausanne, leading to her appeal. Semenya has accused the IAAF of using her as a “human guinea pig”, while they “experiment with how the medication they required me to take would affect my testosterone levels”. Semenya’s case has provoked debate across sport worldwide about gender and “hyperandrogenic” athletes, those with “differences of sexual development”, and the ethics of the IAAF. She said she was fighting a bigger battle beyond the track. “This is more than a game, more than sport,” she said. “This is about human dignity, human pride.” Val Boje Pretoria News
