This despite two online reports claiming that residents would have to drink “possibly unsafe” water. According to the publications, monitoring points had challenges with colour, turbidity, ammonia and some general microbiological determinants. Tau said the city had disapproved of this notion on the basis that officials present at the weekend sampling had mutually agreed that the water colour was acceptable. Tau and metro officials tasted and smelt the water in the area. “Officials went on to drink and smell the water; once again we found it to be completely suitable for drinking.” The water sampling was part of a joint initiative by the metro and water and sanitation department, and the visit by Tau followed a complaint lodged last year, with the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) by Hammanskraal residents about concerns of water quality in that area. On Friday, reports on two online publications claimed there were problems with water colour, turbidity, ammonia and some general microbiological determinants, to which the City strongly disagreed, saying all officials present agreed that the water colour was acceptable. “We would like to assure our residents in Hammanskraal and nearby areas, that the City, in co-operation with DWS and SAHRC, will make every effort to ensure that the quality of the water stays 100% compliant,” said Tau. He said the visit to Hammanskraal was part of an ongoing process to sample water throughout the metro. “In addition, the results of the water samples taken will be made known to the residents, as we are an administration that is open, honest and responsive.” Pretoria News
