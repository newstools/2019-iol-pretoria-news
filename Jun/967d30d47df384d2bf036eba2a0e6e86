“We are dismayed after discovering increasing cases of follow-ups by companies to the City on RFQs (request for quotation) and it is disheartening that many companies have been defrauded this way,” spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said. “All City of Tshwane supply chain procurement adverts are placed on the official website and all relevant documentation relating to the advert are obtainable from e-tenders at the National Treasury website.” He said requests for RFQs would come only from the vendormaster@tshwane.gov.za mailbox with contact details of a supply chain official for enquiries. “We urge the public to be vigilant when dealing with such matters. It is appalling how these scammers prey on the emotions of unsuspecting business communities by manufacturing information about the existence of a tender advert. “We wish to warn those that are peddling such false information that they will be arrested, charged and prosecuted as their actions border on criminality. Further, we urge the public to report such cases to the City’s Anti-Fraud Hotline number, 080 874 9263 or email MoeketsiNT@TSHWANE.GOV.ZA whenever they come across such ‘trade adverts’ that are issued outside the norms and procedures of the City’s processes.” Pretoria News
