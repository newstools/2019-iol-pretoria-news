The officers found that the premises was a mini laboratory for drugs.” Mahamba said the drugs found had an estimated street value of R250000. Four suspects found at the premises were arrested. Another arrest was made when a suspect was found in possession of drugs valued at R27400. More information led to another four suspects being arrested for dealing and possession of drugs with an estimated street value of R350000. “In the two days, the officers arrested 10 people for dealing and possession of drugs in the Centurion area,” said Mahamba. The estimated value of the drugs seized is R632400 and R33790 in cash was seized. All the suspects will appear in court soon. “The department commends the K9 members on a job well done,” he added. - Staff Reporter Pretoria News
