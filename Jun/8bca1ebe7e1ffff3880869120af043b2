Pretoria - It makes no sense to sleep in the streets when government owns a brand new building that hasn’t been unused for years since it was built. This sentiment was expressed by leaders of Pretoria homeless people who yesterday gathered outside the locked building in Salvokop. They said it was about time the Department of Public Works and the City of Tshwane gave them keys to the building. Frustrated and tired of sleeping in dilapidated CBD buildings and cold public parks, the group has been approaching various government departments to speak to executives, trying to get the keys to the building. They said the building was built either in 2014 or 2015 when two homeless shelters for boys were demolished to erect the R1.4bn Stats SA headquarters, nearby. A frustrated Richard Wildeman said: “We don’t care what the building still lacks, we’ll make it work if something inside is not complete. "This building has been unused for about five years. "Just try to imagine how much money was spent to pay security guards and people who kept the yard clean all this time.” Wildeman chairs the newly established New Hope organisation that’s made up of CBD homeless people who want to have one organisation where the homeless could speak for themselves instead of NPOs.
