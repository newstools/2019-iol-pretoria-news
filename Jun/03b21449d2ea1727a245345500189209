But recently, SPCA Tshwane general manager Dewald Wahlstrand said they have been struggling with about 150 dogs and 60 cats being housed at the Waltloo facility. He said one of the reasons for the numbers was irresponsible pet owners and another was the fact that the city does not have proper sterilisation by-laws in place. Assuming a bitch can produce four puppies a year, over the years one would have hundreds of thousands of dogs, he said. Spokesperson Elsa Daniels said: “We have too many animals on the streets, and people do not take responsibility for them. And then they come to drop them with us but we never turn away animals. “We make a plan when a dog is (found) lying half dead on the road.” Daniels said after several attempts to get the city to help enforce the by-laws to conduct mass sterilisation, it was advised that for that to happen the SPCA had to be part of the city’s budget, to be able to cover all the costs. SPCA Tshwane was awaiting a response from the council to be considered in the budget. The city responded that it was looking into the request. Pretoria News
