They said the work, which was essential, could affect water provision to a number of suburbs of Tshwane such as Ga-Rankuwa Industrial sites, Mabopane, Ga-Rankuwa, Akasia Park, Kruisfontein, Brakfontein, Pretoria West, Wonderboom, Saulsville, Erasmia, Kosmosdal, Rooihuiskraal, Thaba Tshwane and Blair Athol. All affected reservoirs will be filled prior to the shutdown to minimise the impact. The City has apologised for the inconvenience and urged residents to use water sparingly. A number of water disruptions are expected in the City this week due to local planned maintenance work. Residents of Bronberg, Olympus and Boardwalk face sporadic water supply interruption. This is to allow a connection for Bronberg at the intersections of Ajax Avenue, Neptune Road, Achilles Way and Midas Avenue. A tie-in connection is also scheduled for Wednesday next week in Wierdapark Extension 1 at the intersection of Hoep-Hoep Avenue and Ibis Road. - Staff Reporter Pretoria News
