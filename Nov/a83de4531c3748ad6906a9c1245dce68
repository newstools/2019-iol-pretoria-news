Pretoria - It’s all systems go for Tshwane as President Cyril Ramaphosa launched the Tshwane Automotive Hub at the Ford Motor Company in Silverton. The automotive hub will be developed on 162 hectares of land inside the Ford plant and the hub will focus on automotive component manufacturing. The hub is an outcome of the SA Investment Conference held last year, when a pledge was made to invest in the Automotive Master Development Plan 2035.

"I’m so encouraged by this,” Ramaphosa. The Hub is also expected to lead to many other business opportunities, such as for component manufacturers in the surrounding areas of Silverton, Eersterust and Mamelodi. The Tshwane Auto Special Economic Zone was designed to play a crucial role in facilitating inclusive and sustainable economic development. “This will go a long way in lowering the rampant joblessness, stimulate demand and contribute to economic growth." The metro is one of the latest auto assembly centres on the continent and the planned expansion will consolidate its role as a leading centre. Executive mayor Stevens Mokgalapa said total production impact of the zone would be R6.7billion. This is made up of a total direct impact of R2.887bn, an indirect impact of R2.231bn, and an induced impact of R1.584bn. Pretoria News
