The seat which Koos Strydom, 54, occupied for weeks on end during the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, trial was empty after he apparently took an overdose of tablets in September while awaiting trial in the Kgosi Mampuru Prison. He was found unconscious in his cell at the time and rushed to hospital. However, he died the following day. His 23-year-old wife Mercia Strydom, meanwhile, told the court that she had no money to continue paying the private attorney who represented her and her husband. Legal Aid South Africa appointed a state-paid attorney on her behalf. He, however, still has to work through all the evidence. Judge Bert Bam ordered that the trial is to resume from February 10 and run until February 21. Strydom was implicated by several witnesses as the mastermind behind the murders of the Van Niekerks. The couple went missing on December 10, 2017, from their plot in Mooinooi, North West. It was claimed that Strydom wanted to force Anisha to sell their smallholding to him, but she refused. He apparently forced her to sign an agreement of sale, after which she and her wife were allegedly raped and killed. Witnesses testified how the couple pleaded for their lives when they were allegedly gang raped, hanged and later set alight. Their remains were found weeks later in the veld near Brits. Witnesses were placed under the witness protection plan as they feared Strydom. This included his own son Vincent, who said his father threatened to kill him if he spoke about the events in this case. Pretoria News
