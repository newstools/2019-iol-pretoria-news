Hosted by the Department of Sport and Recreation as part of its IChoose2BActive campaign, the walk offered, 5km, 10km and 15km events and saw residents coming out in their numbers. Speaking to the Pretoria News at Fountains Valley, Jessica Dlamini said she had been waiting for the walk for a month and was excited to take part. “It is lovely to walk in our beautiful city and experience the nature while keeping fit; more people should join in and use this month to build up healthy habits.” Patrice Jiya said he was an active person and hoped next time a half-marathon would be offered.  “This gives us a chance to walk with our families and meet other fitness fanatics and we could start our own clubs that walk together and create more social cohesion.” Katie Coetzee, 14, said she enjoyed going on walks and wanted to be a marathon runner. “I can win races, be famous and stay fit at the same time.” The walk followed the National Recreational Day held at the Union Buildings on Friday, which drew a huge turnout and offered morabaraba and archery in a bid to promote fitness.
