Pretoria - Hammanskraal residents who’ve been fetching water from water tankers expressed excitement towards a R253 million cash injection to refurbish the overworked Rooiwal Water Treatment Plant. This comes after mayor Stevens Mokgalapa on Friday officially handed the plant to contractors to commence the rehabilitation process of the plant that cleans most of the City’s sewage water. Fears of possible contaminated water had residents of the township opt to only use water brought to their streets in trucks for domestic purposes instead of the piped water that’s available in their yards. Pretoria News interviewed locals who were fetching water in various containers from the trucks. They said the rehabilitation of the plant was crucially important because this new lifestyle was just not desirable in Gauteng. They said this task was demanding and draining, especially in recent hot days. Most of the residents said they simply could not wait for the two years rehabilitation process to start yielding results so that they could go back to fetching water in their own yards like most people. However, informal trader Khulufelo Mashigo said business has been doing great as he sold bottled water to locals and motorists driving between Dertig and Temba. Most of his customers were motorists travelling between Pretoria, Temba, Dertig, Mathibestad and Makapan as many of them do not trust the piped water, he explained. Pretoria News
