Dr Motodi Maserumule is being assisted by AfriForum. “The police failed to execute their duties during a land grab that took place on the premises,” AfriForum said. They said the police refused to assist Maserumule last August by failing to arrest trespassers who unlawfully entered his land and started erecting structures. Maserumule approached AfriForum and obtained an urgent court order which instructed that the trespassers be removed, and that the police must co-operate with the sheriff in this regard. Maserumule and AfriForum gave the Red Ants a mandate to help remove the trespassers and structures. “AfriForum is becoming involved with cases such as these to ensure that the police are forced to do their work. We are hoping that this claim will serve as deterrent should the police in future hesitate to execute their constitutional mandate. “AfriForum will supervise this litigation process in order to make the community aware of the fact that the slackness of the law enforcement authorities will not go by unnoticed. “This summons will serve as a sword over the head of institutions that are tasked by the Constitution to protect citizens against crime. They need to execute their mandate or carry the consequences,” said Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s head of community safety. Staff Reporter Pretoria News
