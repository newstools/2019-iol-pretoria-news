Pretoria - The Mamelodi home of Martha Mahlangu, the mother of struggle icon Solomon Mahlangu, would be turned into a national heritage site, the National Heritage Council has said. The announcement of the declaration was made on Wednesday afternoon by the CEO of the National Heritage Council Advocate Sonwabile Mancotywa. He was speaking at a media briefing during the 40th commemoration of the late Solomon Mahlangu at the freedom fighter’s house in Mamelodi West. The process of declaring the area a national heritage site was already on track and will be marked by public consultations. ”In fact, we are 90% through it and we just need 10% of public consultations and a feasibility report from the family. "We will then study the report and forge a way forward,” he said. Mancotywa said the site has now been declared a category 1 national heritage site. “It has passed all the necessary grading. "What remains now is the technical aspect, this among others things, means the community will be consulted,” he said. So far no price tag or time span has been put on the project. Pretoria News
