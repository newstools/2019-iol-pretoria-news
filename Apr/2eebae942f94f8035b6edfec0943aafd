The SA Weather Services (SAWS) partnered with the university to showcase the world-class station that is expected to provide hazardous weather warnings, alerts and site-specific forecasts to people on campus and to the SAWS. The readings can be seen on a screen set up on campus. The university expects the innovation to enable knowledge-sharing and research in climate and technical services, as well as forecasting and training. Management already expects the station to help in decision-making for sporting events, saying lives could be saved from early warning of imminent lightning storms. The launch was celebrated by all professionals who worked on the project and students who came to witness history unfold right before their eyes. Acting SAWS chief executive Mnikeli Ndabambi said: “Severe thunderstorms produce damaging hail, stormy winds and flash flooding. With a radar network we can give you the exact time when it will hit this institution so you can at least park your cars under shelter. “I am told this weather station is already contributing to the SA Weather Services network.” Pretoria News
