Vandals have stripped the building of materials, including steel doors, window frames, bathroom accessories and cables. The fire was reported to have been ignited by rent defaulters who had been evicted from neighbouring Schubart Park. A decade ago, Kruger Park was set to be imploded due to being unsafe for human occupation. However, a case opposing the demolition of the building was heard in the Constitutional Court, which ruled against the plans. But in his first 50 days in office, executive mayor Stevens Mokgalapa has released the building for redevelopment as a student village. According to city spokesperson Lindela Mashigo, Schubart Park remained the subject of a West Capital Development court proceeding and could not be developed until effective assessments were settled to evaluate the possible risks of redeveloping it. “The Department of Human Settlements has sent out a request for proposals requesting companies who would want to be considered in the redevelopment of Kruger Park, to send their applications.” The building has in the past been earmarked by Tshwane for accommodation both for students and the homeless. At some stage, it was to be converted into an office park, but nothing happened. It then became a haven for illegal activities. Pretoria News
