Senesispo Dambile continued the proud legacy set by his predecessors Clarence Munyai and Gift Leotlela (former Athletics Foundation Trust athletes) by winning the 200m in 20.51. His winning time is a new South African youth record. More importantly, it is one of the fastest times by an Under-18 athlete yet. It ranks him among the top ten on the International Association of Athletics Federations’ list and led to him receiving the Best Athlete of the Meeting award. He was not the only sprinter to excel. Thabang Hlohlolo, who is also sponsored by the Athletics Foundation Trust, was victorious in the U18 boys final and was clocked at 10.61. It is still early days, but Prudence Sekgodiso might just be the next real deal in South African women’s middle distance racing. She won the 800m junior race in a time of 2:07.03 but was faster in the heats clocking 2:05.06. Sekgodiso, as an U18 athlete, could cause a surprise over the weekend when competing in the 800m during the SA Championships. If she can come close to running 2:03.98, which is her personal best, there is a real chance that she could win a medal. African News Agency (ANA)
