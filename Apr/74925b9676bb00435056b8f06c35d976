In the past year, the increase in the number of children drowning in dams, canals and rivers prompted the Department of Water and Sanitation to intensify its Water Safety campaign in an effort to educate people about the dangers associated with activities near and in water. Spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said: “We have tried to educate people through our awareness campaigns, but we still feel that is not enough. There is still a need for people to know that as much as water is good, recreational activities in water can also have bad consequences.” Ratau encouraged people to take note of water safety tips they should follow when engaging in recreational activities. “I would like to advise parents to keep their children in check to avoid drownings. “Adults are also warned not to consume alcohol near dams as they are likely to end up drowning,” Ratau said. The World Health Organisation has found drowning is the third most common cause of unintentional deaths globally, with an estimated mortality rate of 7.4 per 100000 people. The rate of drowning in Africa was considerably higher at 13.1 per 100000 people, and in 2012 the continent was found to account for 20% of drownings globally. Pretoria News
