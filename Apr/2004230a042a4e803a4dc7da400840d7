Pretoria - Traffic is following steadily along Solomon Mahlangu Drive in Mamelodi as a heavy police presence keep an eye on protesting taxi drivers. Police have had their hands full trying to disperse the protesters. Tyres and debris have been burning since early morning. Although traffic is following, part of Solomon Mahlangu Drive leading to Mahube has been closed off by livid taxi drivers. On Wednesday morning the township erupted with taxi drivers refusing to commute residents and instead they protested. They said they were angry because they used to pay R55 to the Mamelodi Taxi Association (Mata), but after Vusi “Khekhe" Mathibela took over it went up to R200 Association. General Secretary of Mata, Bonnie Ndjishe said the allegations were false. “But everything will be ironed out after the meeting,” he said. Taxi drivers have been in a meeting with Mata since 10am.

Mathibela was arrested on March 16 for allegedly being part of a group terrorising the community of Mamelodi over a period of time. The arrest comes after police minister Bheki Cele held meetings with the community in which they raised concerns about Mthibela’s reign of terror. Cele told taxi drivers not to pay the fee until Mathibela’s matter is resolved. Pretoria News
