Pretoria - A larger crowd has turned out at the Union Bulidings compared to the poor one earlier at the old Putco depot in Marabastad. The turnout was poor this morning with about 50 disgruntled residents at the depot. It was predicted that 12 000 would march stemming from the taxi associations, civic organisations and residents from various townships in Tshwane. There are now about 250 protesters at the Union Buildings. The city was supposed to be disrupted causing chaos, but it seems to be business as usual.

Organiser of the “stayaway” Inwooners Baagi Civic Movement's  Makgoka Lekgayane acclaimed the lack of attendance to “sabotage”. “We were denied buses from government. They don’t want to help us fight our cause because they are responsible for it, “ he said. Protesters from Mamelodi have saved the day, adding numbers to the struggling few. They are currently on the Union Buildings lawns trying to hand over a memorandum. Chief among their pleas is exorbitant rates and bills. Metro police spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the March was illegal. He said there was one violent incident reported in Winterveld. Pretoria News
