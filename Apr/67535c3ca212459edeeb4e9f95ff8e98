Pretoria - Protest action is underway in Mamelodi as members of the Mamelodi Taxi Association refuse to pay an inflated fee to Vusi “Khekhe" Mathibela Tyres and debris have been burning since 5am on Solomon Mahlangu Drive and Tsamaya Street. Commuters are stranded with buses also affected. The drivers are protesting over an inflated taxi fee. According to taxi driver who only gave his first name as Joseph they started paying R55 to the association, but after Mathibela took over it went up to R200. Mathibela was arrested on March 16 for allegedly being part of a group terrorising the community of Mamelodi over a period of time. The arrest comes after police minister Bheki Cele held meetings with the community in which they raised concerns about Mathibela’s reign of terror. Cele told taxi drivers not to pay the fee until Mathibela’s matter is resolved. But taxi drivers said Mathibela’s cronies have been collecting the fee on the side. The association is scheduled to have a meeting with drivers at 10am. Pretoria News
