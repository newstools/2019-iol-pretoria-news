Pretoria - In less than a week, Freedom The Musical, a groundbreaking production that examines crime and violence in modern day society, will return to the State Theatre. Directed by multi-award winning playwright Aubrey Sekhabi, the 47 cast members and a 13-piece band tells the story of Phindile, portrayed by Simphiwe Ndlovu, a Tshwane University of Technology student and leader of the Fees Must Fall movement. The musical will run from April 30 to June 2. The story is a testament to her determination to triumph regardless of the odds stacked against her by the system and society. She will stop at nothing to fight for the freedom of students, free education and her own freedom. The musical premiered at the State Theatre last year. This year the musical makes a return with eight Naledi nominations for awards including Best Musical Production, New Script, Original Score, Choreography (Mduduzi Nhlapo) and Set Design (Wilhelm Disbergen). Former lead actress Simphiwe Ndlovu (as Phindile) will compete in the Best Female Musical lead category. The 2019 Naledi Awards will be held at the Joburg Theatre on May 20 2019 Tickets range from R100 to R300. The show has a 13 age restriction. Pretoria News
