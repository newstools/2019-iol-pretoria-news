Pretoria - Mayor of Tshwane Stevens Mokgalapa said small to medium enterprises would be the backbone of economic growth in the municipality and the country. He pleaded with a group of business people to join hands with government and support them during a business meeting in Menlyn on Thursday. The meeting was hosted by the Tshwane Economic Development Agency (Teda) in conjunction with the City and Capital City Chamber under the theme 'Growing the Capital City'. He said the informal economic space would be contributory to empowering people "who will be enabled to participate in the economy". "Currently, there is a large decent work deficit in the informal economy. "There is a need to promote decent work; compliance and enforcement; organisation of representation, access to finance, access to markets and entrepreneurship," he said. Mokgalapa said workers and economic units in the informal economy did not enjoy secure property rights "which deprives them to access both capital and credit". "Women, young persons, migrant and all the workers are especially vulnerable to the most serious decent work deficits in the informal economy," he said. Mokgalapa said the City of Tshwane was ideally placed to serve Africa’s largest market in Gauteng, other South African centres, African countries to the North, and global markets. "We are, therefore, fully geared towards positioning the City of Tshwane as the preferred destination for trade and investment," said. Pretoria News
