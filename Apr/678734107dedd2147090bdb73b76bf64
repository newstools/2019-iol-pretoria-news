Pretoria - Only a fraction of the expected 12 000 disgruntled residents have gathered at the old Putco depot in Marabastad. Just two buses have arrived at the open field. About 50 protesters have been singing and chanting, while police keep a close eye on them. Several communities, taxi associations and worker unions were to take part in what has been dubbed the #TshwaneTotalShutdown. Marchers were meant to gather at Marabastad at 10am before making their way to the Union Buildings. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

One of the organisers, David Ratladi said issues to be raised with President Cyril Ramphosa's office include potholes, public transport arriving late, no streetlights and a lack of clinics. But SA National Taxi Association (Santaco) Tshwane chairman Motlhabane Tsebe said the taxi associations were not apart of the shutdown. “We were just as surprised to see the pamphlet circulating on social media and implicating us,” he said. Tsebe said there had been no communication between them and the shutdown organisers. “We don't even know who they are,” he said. Echoing his sentiments was Minister of Transport Blaze Nzimande who said he also learned about the shutdown from social media posts but cant confirm its authenticity. Metro police spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the March was illegal. Pretoria News
