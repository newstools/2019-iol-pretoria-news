The shutdown was prompted by the shooting of 13-year-old pupil during class about two weeks ago. Parents were initially upset that they had not been informed about the incident but a meeting was convened at the weekend. Last week, parents claimed a gang notorious for terrorising the community was behind the shooting of the Grade 6 pupil. The parents blamed a gang known as Ma Russia, which they said was for recruiting pupils and youngsters from the area. They shut down the school on Wednesday, accusing the school of withholding information on the incident. Details of the shooting remained sketchy. The victim had apparently stood up to borrow a pen before falling down screaming in agony. When his teacher rushed to check on him, she found a gaping wound in his shoulder. A parent said the meeting still did not answer their questions. "Parents just decided to do what’s best for the children and stopped the disruptions, but safety remains our biggest concern.” By yesterday, police said no arrests had been made yet. Pretoria News
