Pretoria - Mamelodi's so-called number one Tsotsi, Vusi “Khekhe” Mathibela is set to fight back and challenge an order by the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, to toss aside his motion to challenge the legality of his arrest. The controversial businessman gave his team of lawyers instructions to challenge the legal system again with yet another urgent high court application. This comes a couple of weeks after he opted to abandon his bail bid in order to convince the high court to declare his recent arrest unlawful and have it set aside. He was arrested in March and accused of leading a ring of extortionists who intimidated Mamelodi business people and made them pay protection fees. Mathibela was already out on bail for his alleged involvement in the murder of another businessman Wandile Bozwana when he was arrested. Instructing attorney Solomon Mkhabela said: “We have been given instruction to use legal remedies to challenge the order by the high court to dismiss Mathibela’s motion to challenge the legality of his arrest. “This is an urgent application and we have asked the court to give us reasons for the decisions to give that order. We were under the impression that we would receive a judgment after arguments were made for and against the motion but the court gave the order.” Pretoria News
