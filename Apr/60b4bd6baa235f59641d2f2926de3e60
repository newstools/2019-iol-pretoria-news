ANC councillors demanded that the Speaker, Katlego Mathebe, postpone the sitting in honour of Solomon Mahlangu. The event had coincided with what was then the 38th anniversary of Mahlangu’s execution. Last year, Soca moved to the new council chamber at Tshwane House and proceeded without disruption. This year - later this morning, to be exact - executive mayor Stevens Mokgalapa will deliver his maiden Soca. However, in the past 24 hours rumours have been circulating that protests will erupt in townships to revolt against the DA-led government in the city. It is uncertain where the threats come from, but should the protests go ahead, there is no confirming what impact this will have on Mokgalapa’s show. A local version of the State of the Nation address, Soca is crucial as it outlines the plans the government of the day has for the citizenry. It will be a huge statement against the DA-led government if the public go ahead with the alleged protests. That said, all will become clearer as the morning unfolds. Pretoria News
