“If we build in a way that encourages people to live a healthy lifestyle, want to support the environment and want to make a change, it will be so much easier because it will be in your home and in your space,” said the new Miss Earth South Africa who was crowned on Friday. The event took place at the The Palazzo at Montecasino where all 11 finalists came together and spoke out about the impact their chosen projects had had. The Miss Earth SA is a women's empowerment and leadership development programme with a focus on sustainability and conservation issues. The programme aims to create awareness of sustainable development, wildlife and the conservation of the natural legacy in the country, by giving young women a platform and the support to do community work. The 22-year-old Katete from Gauteng recently completed her Bachelors in Architectural Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand and is now an architectural technician with an awareness of the impact of the built environment. Catherine Constantinides, the Miss Earth national director, said Katete stood out to the judges because of her positive energy, and she wished her well. Pretoria News
