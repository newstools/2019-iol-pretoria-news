A total of R76.8 million was currently outstanding in unpaid rental fees for properties under Public Works and Infrastructure Department’s custodianship.

De Lille also said her department has developed acquisition and disposal framework in collaboration with the National Treasury with the latter appointing new officials in the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer. She said there would have to be further engagements before finalization of the framework. "The department’s Real Estate Management branch regularly convenes engagements with provinces to discuss various matters in the leasing and letting environment. "The next meeting will take place in September and will be hosted by the Gauteng provincial Department of Infrastructure Development". De Lille added that her department incurred R48 100 in legal fees for collecting debt from outstanding rental fees from entities renting property from her department. She said R25600 was incurred in 2017-18 and a further R22 500 since April 2019. Political Bureau
