Civilians found wearing the outfit could be liable for a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. The SANDF has again advised the public to desist from wearing the patented material. Spokesperson Brigadier-General Mafi Mgobozi said they noted in 2017 a trend of members of the public who were, either knowingly or unknowingly, wearing various items of camouflage, which was illegal. In terms of the Defence Act, any person who without authority possessed or wore prescribed uniforms (with) distinctive marks or crests, or performs any prohibited act while wearing such a uniform or with such a uniform, was guilty of an offence. Mgobozi added: “Members of the public who are illegally in possession of a complete or various items of the SANDF camouflage uniform are urged and encouraged to return the items to their nearest base or unit.” The reason for the restrictions, Mgobozi said, was due to the fact that camouflage had been registered as a patent for use solely by authorised members of the military. Alternatively, it may also be worn by members identified by the chief of the military and appointed as honorary members of the various units or bases. He added that even family members of military personnel who had resigned or retired from active duty were not permitted to wear, model, display or sell any items of the military uniform.
