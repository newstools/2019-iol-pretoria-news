The area has been without water since the weekend due to a major burst pipe at Fountains. The MMC for Utility Services, Abel Tau, said engineers from the water and sanitation department had managed to conclude repairs, enabling the City to pump water from the Salvokop reservoir into the system. However, he said the water supply would not return immediately to the affected areas as the process of filling up the water network system would be done slowly to prevent further damage. “The engineers have to be cautious when pumping water into the system to avoid any hiccups, such as leakages or further pipe bursts. Water will be gradually opened into the grid. “The City’s engineers are monitoring the grid and it is hoped that it will soon stabilise. Please note that residents in the low-lying areas will be the first to receive water.” “It is important for consumers to be prudent when using water. The City urges consumers not to water gardens, wash cars, fill swimming pools until the flow of water has normalised.”
