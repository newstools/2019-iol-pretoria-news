It will take place at the Voortrekker Monument and three music stages will be set up. The festival will feature a dynamic line-up from major stars to local groups, including Kwesta, A-Reece, Boity, Moozlie, Zakes Bantwini, Da Capo and many more. Last year the festival attracted more than 8000 people and this year it could grow more. The managing director of Homecoming Events, Katlego Malatji, said the festival would bring about a significant shift in the way people viewed events, social responsibilities and music on the continent. “It is the start of something very special. Experience the best in music, comedy and service as this year the Homecoming Africa Festival will launch their community service initiative that is aimed at giving back on the first day of the festival. “The second day will consist of a comedy night, where local comedians will get an opportunity to showcase the growing comedic community in Pretoria and the rest of South Africa." Music lovers can still enjoy a variety of house, hip hop and kwaito music on the final day of the festival, Malatji said. "Homecoming Africa lovers can once again expect another insanely lined up event this year.” Tickets are from R150 to R650. Pretoria News
