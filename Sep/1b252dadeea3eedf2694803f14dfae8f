Kagiso Makobe, founder and creator of Pitori craft beer, said the idea was brought initially by Solofelang Tlhadi. Makobe said Tlhadi, who had a background in the industrial sector, brought to life the idea of local people to start enjoying local brands. He said that after two years of research, Pitori beer was born, initially supplied to local clubs in 30-litre kegs, in November last year. Makobe said they first thought of calling it Soso after the original founder, and thereafter they tried Kasi Beer. “We settled on Pitori because we didn’t want to bind it to just a particular area or township. It’s for all of Tshwane, hence the name and the signature emblem of the Union Buildings as well. “We have two styles - a lager for the men and a new distinctive raspberry and lime cider for women or those with a sweet tooth.” For youngsters looking to get into the business, Makobe advised them to know that the market was still open for new ideas or even reinventing the existing opportunities. “Even for something like a pen, if you research it and find a way to reinvent it, people will support you as they are craving something new.” Pretoria News
