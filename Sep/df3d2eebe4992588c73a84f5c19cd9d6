The event, now in its eighth year, ushered in the warmer season in style. Participants clad in bright orange T-shirts took on the streets of the Hatfield area in a 5km, 10km and 15km fitness and fun event, ending at iconic Loftus Versfeld Stadium. First-time participant Kamogelo Sibanyoni was full of praise for the event. “It’s a great vibe with great people and the weather is on our side. I could kick myself for missing out in past years.” And “old hand” Christoper Godfrey said he had not once missed the event since its inception. “It has become a ritual in our family. It’s such a great way to connect with fellow Pretorians,” he said. The 8 000-strong participants were also given medals and were treated to live entertainment and a picnic at Loftus. “The Discovery Jacaranda FM Spring Walk always promises a terrific vibe, and this year did not disappoint,” said Discovery’s Iona Maclean. Jacaranda FM general manager Kevin Fine said the highlight was appearances by celebrities by DJ Jazzy D and Lisa Raleigh and fantastic on-stage performances from Nick McCreadie, Roan Ash and Bok van Blerk.
