An added benefit of the new routing is that the iconic event will now start and finish in Eeufees Road in front of the Voortrekker Monument. The Bestmed Tshwane Classic, presented in association with the City of Tshwane, Office National and Jacaranda FM, takes place on November 3. Up to 12 000 cyclists are expected to take part in the cycling road race. Race director Darren Herbst has been hard at work with Tshwane Metro Police events logistical head Wynand Scholtz, sourcing a route through the city. Their efforts have paid off with a flowing route which now avoids the congested city centre. The race was presented for the first time in 2017. It was a remarkable success, attracting 5 000 riders.
