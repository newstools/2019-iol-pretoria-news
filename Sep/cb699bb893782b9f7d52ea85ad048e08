Mfundo Buthelezi was making his second appearance and granted R500 bail. Buthelezi had been in custody since September 8, after he allegedly stabbed Sabelo Mbele on September 6, during an altercation following the elections. Mbele, 23, was stabbed eight times on the Soshanguve North Campus and admitted to George Mukhari Hospital in Ga-Rankuwa north of the city. Three other students were injured. The university said it was co-operating with the police, while simultaneously conducting its own probe. There were no protests outside the magistrate's court yesterday, but during the accused's first appearance a group of students affiliated to the DA Student Organisation called for the State to deny Buthelezi bail. DA MPL Crezane Bosch, who led the students in the protest, said the reason behind their call for Buthelezi to be denied bail, was for the safety of all students on campus. University spokesperson Willa de Ruyter previously said they were working closely with the SAPS to make sure alleged perpetrators faced the law. “The university strongly condemns such incidents, since the safety of our students is of utmost importance. We have asked our security team to reinforce security measures at our campuses.” Buthelezi is back in court on October 11. Pretoria News
