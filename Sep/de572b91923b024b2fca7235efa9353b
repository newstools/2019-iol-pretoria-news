"It is with great sadness we confirm our beloved Khosini passed away yesterday afternoon, after suffering a ruptured brain aneurysm which placed him on life support for 23 days. "He passed peacefully at hospital, surrounded by the love of his family. In this time of grief we ask for privacy and the opportunity to celebrate him.
