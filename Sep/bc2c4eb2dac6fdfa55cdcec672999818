Tshwane is expected to come to a standstill as over 30 000 participants take to the streets to showcase the province’s rich cultural heritage through music, dance, fashion and the arts. Organised by the provincial government and the City of Tshwane, the event forms part of the Heritage Day celebrations and is expected to bring in participants from other parts of Africa together with the Chinese, Peruvians and Argentinians. Residents and visitors of Gauteng can look forward to the fusion of cultures into one big spectacle showcasing Africa’s creativeness through floats, 3D costumes, acrobats, enthralling dancers, an eclectic mix of music colourfully parading the capital city. The parade starts from the Union Buildings and will make its way around Sunnyside before returning to the Union Buildings. “We are encouraging all residents of Gauteng and South Africa at large to come and witness the true spirit of ubuntu as we showcase our African cultural diversity, while advancing African solidarity and social cohesion,” said MEC for Sport, Arts Culture and Recreation Mbali Hlophe.
