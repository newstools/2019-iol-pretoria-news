Thabiso Lubisi claimed two men tried to hijack him and Sekhula. He said he had acted in self-defence, which led to Sekhula’s killing. The Soshanguve High School matric pupil was found dead in Winterveld in the early hours of August 4. She had been shot several times. Her body had two bullet wounds to the head. The 19-year-old had apparently broken up with the suspect three weeks before she was murdered. Pupils, friends, family, members of the ANC Women’s League and civil rights organisation #NotInMyName demonstrated outside the court. Lubisi, a father of two, was granted bail of R1000 because he is a breadwinner and there is no one to care for his children. The magistrate concluded that he was not a danger to the community nor was he a flight risk. The matter was postponed until November 26. Ga-Rankuwa branch chairperson of #NotInMyName Kabelo Theoha said they were against bail granted to Lubisi. “It is clear the South African legal system isn’t harsh enough.” Following the postponement, the crowd blocked the court entrance. They danced and chanted for almost two hours, barring cars, including police vehicles, from accessing or leaving the court. Pretoria News
