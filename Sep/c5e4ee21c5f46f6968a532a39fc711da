Cape Town - South Africans in Amsterdam took to Dam Square where they staged their very own "Am I Next" protest to create awareness of gender-based violence and femicide in SA. The move comes after more than 10 000 people dressed in black and purple showed up outside Parliament last week Thursday in a protest against the ongoing violence against women and children in the country. The protests were sparked following the deaths of Uyinene Mrwetyana, Jesse Hess, Leighandré Jegels, Janika Mallo, Lynette Volschenk and Meghan Cremer who were all recently murdered as a result of femicide. A large crowd also gathered outside the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC), where the World Economic Forum took place, to protest against abuse and violence directed at women and children. The crowd of mainly young people from various civil community organisations and students from universities and schools across the city, chanted Struggle songs and held posters saying “enough is enough” and “stop killing women and children”. The recent protests and demonstration left such a mark, that they also inspired a similar protest in Amsterdam in a bid to create awareness of the attacks and murders in SA.             Cape Argus
