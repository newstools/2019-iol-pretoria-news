Tshepo Mokwena, 37, was arrested in 2016 for the rapes committed along the bridge and in nearby bushes between 2006 and 2014. He had been on the run for nearly 10 years. His sentences will each run concurrently. On Wednesday last week Mokwena was convicted of four rape charges as well as assault and robbery. He was sentenced on Friday and he has 14 days to appeal against his sentence. Temba police spokesperson Constable Herman Moremi said there were initially eight cases against Mokwena. All his victims had been taking a short cut in the area of the bridge, and were walking alone when he threatened them with a knife, assaulted and raped them. Three charges were withdrawn by the victims, while one victim has died leading to her case being withdrawn. During the sentencing, Magistrate Edmond Humphreys described Mokwena as heartless and someone who deserved to be removed from society. One of his victims, Dineo Makhubela, said she felt relieved that Mokwena would be locked away for a long time. “I am really happy because he will rot in jail. He really humiliated me.” Temba police station commander Brigadier Martha Mokobori applauded the investigating officer for a job well done which led to the arrest and conviction. Pretoria News
