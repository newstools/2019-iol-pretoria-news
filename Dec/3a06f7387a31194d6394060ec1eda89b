PRETORIA - The Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) on Thursday warned job seekers about a scam inviting applications for a purported 2,000 traineeship opportunities in the law enforcement agency. "The message is circulated electronically and invites targeted individuals to obtain application forms from their nearest regional metro police offices and submit them before 25 January 2020," said TMPD spokesperson, Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba. "The message further states that the individuals must be residents of Tshwane, have a matric certificate, be between the ages of 18 and 35 years and have a drivers licence," Mahamba said. "The invitation notice, the message, is devoid of any truth, as the City of Tshwane only advertises vacant posts in newspapers and on the Job Forum page of its website. We urge the public to ignore the message, as it is a scam." Mahamba said Tshwane was "dismayed" by the scammers who prey on the emotions of unsuspecting job seekers by manufacturing information about the existence of job vacancies. "We suspect that the aim of the scammers is to con vulnerable people who are desperate for jobs. We wish to warn those who are peddling such false information that they will be arrested, charged and prosecuted, as their actions border on criminality," said Mahamba. He advised community members to contact the TMPD or the Tshwane's anti-fraud hotline number whenever they come across “job adverts’’ that are issued outside the norms and procedures of the city's processes.
