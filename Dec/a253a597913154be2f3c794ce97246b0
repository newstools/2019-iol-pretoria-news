Johannesburg - Barely hours after announcing the continuation of Stage 2 load shedding on Monday, Eskom has confirmed that this will move to Stage 4 from 10am until 11pm. The embattled power utility had earlier announced it would continue with stage 2 load shedding from Sunday until 11pm on Monday. The entity also said the probability of load shedding remained high for the week as a result of a shortage of capacity. In a tweet on Monday, however, Eskom confirmed that Stage 2 load shedding would move to stage 4 "due to additional loss of units at our power stations.     Stage 4 requiresÂ load shedding 12 times over a 4-day period for two hours at a time, or 12 times over an 8-day period for four hours at a time. * This is a developing story
