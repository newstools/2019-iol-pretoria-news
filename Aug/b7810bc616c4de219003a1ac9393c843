Pretoria - After losing three weeks of academic time due to continued protests the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University is hoping the calm will remain long enough to allow the university to recoup lost study time. As it stood university spokesperson Dr Eric Pule, said the Head of Schools had already started meetings with class representatives and Student Representative Council members on how best to catch up on their course work. Pule said even though the university might in all probability have to start their final year examinations a bit later, they were still confident they would at least be able to finish the work in time. He said the council of the university had finally managed to meet with disgruntled students and staff and were currently holding engagements with the entire university community on the proposals put forward by stakeholders. For now, however, Pule said they were happy all were in agreement for the academic programme to resume. Of the issues raised Pule said the memorandum included how students felt that there had been no new development at the institution in terms of infrastructure, including poor maintenance of the residences, and lack thereof. “So students were complaining that with the shortage of space and no new residences being built they were forced to reside outside the university campus which was not fair.” Pretoria News
