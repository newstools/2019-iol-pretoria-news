A few years ago, two officers divulged sensitive information about their colleague, which was gathered during a security screening of the woman. The crime intelligence police officer is claiming R420 000 in damages from the SAPS and two other officers after they disclosed classified information which was on her personal file and gathered during a “top-security clearance” of her. Their act caused a false rumour to spread that she and her husband had both tested positive for HIV. Judge Bert Bam ordered that the police - in effect the taxpayer - had to compensate the officer for the humiliation and trauma she had to endure as a result of the gossip. The amount payable to her would be determined at a later stage. The lieutenant-colonel, 43, who cannot be identified, turned to the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, saying she had been defamed and her reputation damaged. The officer said her personal life was compromised after her two colleagues leaked her personal information. To make matters worse the gossipers spread the word that she was HIV-positive, which was untrue. The two officers who revealed her classified information were demoted where they would “handle less sensitive matters”. Zelda Venter Pretoria News
