Frankfurt, Germany â€” German police say a man and a woman were fatally stabbed at a crowded train station in the town of Iserlohn in what was described as an "act of relationship violence." The incident was the third fatal attack at a German train station within a month. The dpa news agency reported on Saturday that police had arrested a 43-year-old man in connection with the attack on the woman, 32, and another man, who was 23. The station was full of people at the time, police said, including a wedding party of around 20 people. The suspect surrendered to police at the scene without resisting. Police said in a statement that investigators found no reason to consider the attack as anything other than a case of domestic violence. The killings follow two other widely reported homicides at train stations in Germany. An 8-year-old boy died July 29 after being pushed in front of a train in Frankfurt; police say the suspect, a 40-year-old Eritrean residing in Switzerland, had been under psychiatric treatment. On July 20, a 34-year-old woman was pushed in front of a train in Voerde. She and the 28-year-old suspect weren't acquainted. After the Frankfurt killing, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer called for more police at train stations and more security cameras in public places. AP
