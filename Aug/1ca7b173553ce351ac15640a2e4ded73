Pretoria - A furious group of protesting City of Tshwane municipal workers are causing havoc in the Pretoria CBD, forcing businesses to close shops as they march through the streets. They also looked menacing to onlookers, who used their mobile phones to take pictures. Public members who took pictures and videos found themselves at the receiving end of their anger as they were ordered to delete images from phones immediately. Traffic at various intersections is disrupted as motorists are ordered to drive back. Vehicles were turned back in Madiba Street and drove the wrong way down the one-way street. The streets, which looked clean in the morning are being littered with rubbish again. The incidents on Thursday marked the fourth day of the workers' strike over an 18% salary increment. Their protest went ahead despite the ongoing talks between their labour union, the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) and the City of Tshwane taking place at the South African Local Government Bargaining Council in Centurion. Talks started yesterday with Samwu putting on the table its proposal demonstrating how the municipality can be able to implement its demands of salary increases. Workers are up in arms after the City had given an 18% increase to senior managers, excluding the majority of them. Yesterday, the business fraternity in the CBD decried that the strike has affected their enterprises negatively since it started on Monday. Pretoria News
