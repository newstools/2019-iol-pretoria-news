Pretoria - Policing authorities are set to step-up efforts to confront illegal squatters and criminals terrorising the Wonderboom National Airport and nearby residents and businesses. Facilitating the “much needed” operation was ward councillor, Lenise Breytenbach, who launched a 100 Days Change operation to work with stakeholders to turn things around. Plans for an intense operation are already in motion and leaders of the involved parties were taken on a flight around the hotspots to get a good appreciation of the nature of the problem. Airport manager, Waheed Mohammed, said the burning of material around its fences at one point caused a bird strike above the airport. He said, as if that was not enough, criminals stole three cars at the airport earlier this year. Cables were also stolen that were linked to equipment helping pilots to land planes. Numerous illegal shacks were built in the open field around the airport, in Sinoville and Annlin extensions 36 and 37. Some of these shacks are hidden under trees. Pretoria News
