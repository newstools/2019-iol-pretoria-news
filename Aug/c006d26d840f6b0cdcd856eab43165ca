Though she was unsurprisingly the player of the match, she is a real team member, something that showed against Kovsies, and in fact, has been obvious since she started playing netball in primary school. There can be, however, no arguing that Mdau is blessed with having an X-factor. As a wing attack, she can change the direction of any game in a flash. It is one of the reasons why she was selected in the Proteas squad that prepared for the World Cup tournament. The fact that she was not selected in the end did hurt, but the Tuks captain took the setback in her stride. “I am still young. I still need to gain more experience. There is no better way of doing so being on the sidelines, watching the best play. “I realised quite early on in my playing career that talent is only going to take me so far. “The rest is about hard work and dedication,” said Mdau. She describes playing for Tuks as a life-changing experience as it is where she learnt professionalism. She considers graduating with a degree in agriculture economics as a personal highlight. - African News Agency (ANA) Pretoria News
