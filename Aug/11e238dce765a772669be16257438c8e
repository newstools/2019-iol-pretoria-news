Boyes, 65, died on Wednesday night after a short illness. “We are saddened by the loss of Carol, who passed away last night after a brief illness,” Stuurman said. Boyes was the founder, designer and CEO of her eponymous homeware company. A former teacher, Boyes began crafting sculptural tableware at her Cape Town home in 1989. She created a distinctive brand of cutlery and flatware, later branching out into home fabrics, that attracted an international clientele and is sold in 30 countries. Boyes used pewter and unconventional designs for the extensive collection of cutlery that rapidly become her trademark, fashioning spoon handles in the shape of a streamlined diving figure, for example. “Carrol leaves our nation with a legacy of excellence, unity, empowerment and pioneering functional art. She will be greatly missed,” the company said. African News Agency (ANA) Pretoria News
