It is always rewarding for us to hear from the teams and their teachers how much they enjoy testing their knowledge against teams from other schools. About 40 teams participated in the first round of the quiz this week at host venues St Alban’s College, Pretoria Boys High, and Leriba Lodge, and the top three from each round will face off in the regional final at the end of the month, with two teams ultimately going on to represent the Pretoria News in the national final in which the questions are drawn from online content on IOL.co.za Last year, these two teams were from Pretoria Boys and the Pretoria Chinese School, and I am pleased to see the same teams are back along with many new entrants. This year the quiz won Independent Media recognition from the ­International News Media Association as the winner of the category, best use of an event to build a news brand. We look forward to continuing with the quiz in years to come, and wish our teams well in the next round. Pretoria News
