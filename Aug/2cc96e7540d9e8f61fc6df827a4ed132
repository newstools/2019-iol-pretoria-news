Since its inception in 2006, National Parks Week has seen an influx of 437159 day visitors in all participating national parks. The concept of National Parks Week was established in a bid to cultivate a sense of pride in South Africa’s natural, cultural and historical heritage, protected by the National Parks system.” The week will start with an official opening by the Minister of the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Barbara Creecy, at Bontebok National Park near Swellendam. There will also be a soccer tournament and choir competition before the official opening, and members of the public are invited to join in supporting the choirs and soccer teams. All 19 national parks, excluding Namaqua and Boulders in Table Mountain, will be participating in the initiative to give the public an understanding of the role SANParks plays as custodian of the country’s natural heritage.
