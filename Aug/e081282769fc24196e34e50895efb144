Lilongwe - The Human Rights Defenders Coalition (HRDC), an organisation behind the ongoing post-election protests in Malawi, announced here that their next move is to take the demonstrations to the country's airports and borders. HRDC Chairman Timothy Mtambo made the announcement Wednesday at the end of their vigil, which followed demonstrations in the captial a day earlier that tried to force Jane Ansah, the chairwoman of Malawi's electoral body to resign. The HRDC and opposition parties in Malawi accused Ansah of mismanaging the May 21 presidential elections results. The Malawi government is yet to comment on the demonstrations and the consequent damages in Lilongwe. Government spokesman Mark Botomani said on Monday that any demonstration in the next two days "will be treated as unlawful assembly." During the same day, the Malawi High Court threw out a petition by the attorney-general, who has sought to ban the protests. Malawi police spokesman James Kadadzera told the local media that police would issue a statement on the extent of damages during the protests, including the torching of a police armored vehicle.
