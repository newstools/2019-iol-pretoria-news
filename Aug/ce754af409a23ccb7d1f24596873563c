According to the police, criminals had followed people from banks to their homes, and had robbed them of their money. In two instances, people had been killed. Police spokesperson Captain Matthews Nkoadi said a pensioner who lived alone was targeted after withdrawing a large sum of money. Lereng Makhuza, 63, had been found dead in his home last Tuesday morning. He had been electrocuted. Both his hands and legs were tied with steel wire, and his house ransacked. Two suspects, aged 20 and 30, who allegedly made off with four cellphones, a laptop and a printer, had been arrested. They appeared in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrate’s Court on Monday, and were remanded in custody until August 16 for further investigation. Makhuza’s murder came a few weeks after a 47-year-old man was found murdered in Zone 4. He had been followed home after withdrawing R40 000 from a bank. Nkoadi said several cases had been reported at the local police station. “The criminals are careful when choosing their targets. They are intelligent. They wait inside the banks and look out for any person withdrawing large sums of cash. They follow people from the bank to their homes and then rob them and even kill them.” He warned residents to be on the lookout, avoid revealing cash and not carry large sums of money. Pretoria News
