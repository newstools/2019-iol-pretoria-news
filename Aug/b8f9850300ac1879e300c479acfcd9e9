The group, under the umbrella of a charity organisation called Dare-to-Love Movement, embarked on a clean-up campaign at Church Square. About 150 participants converged at 6.30am to take part in the campaign. Their leader, Daryl Hardy, said the strike had spurred them into action to do their part by cleaning up the city. “They decided to clean in a responsible way by separating recyclables in clear bags and wet waste into refuse bags. About 80% to 90% of the waste collected is recyclable, and the homeless can resell this material,” he said. Hardy said the movement started in 2015 and had a mission to challenge believers to take up their social responsibility towards the homeless, elderly, orphans, strangers, their towns and cities. “It started when five believers spent two hours on Saturday mornings in the city CBD, reaching out to the homeless. Four years later, the movement has grown so big that there are multiple participants,” he said, adding that through the movement many homeless were encouraged to help each other. Pretoria News
