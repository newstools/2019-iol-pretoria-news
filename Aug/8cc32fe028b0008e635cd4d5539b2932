The allocation is part of a R2.8bn request, with the balance to be considered in the 2020/21 budgetary process. Denel’s chief executive Danie du Toit expressed the company’s gratitude, and said the support demonstrated confidence at high level “for the measures taken by the new board and management and a commitment to support us through the next stages of the turnaround”. “(It) will enable Denel to improve delivery performance and support to local and international customers. “It will also bring relief to our partners and supply chains who have been affected by Denel’s liquidity issues in recent months,” he said. Denel is to dispose of non-core assets and establish strategic equity partnerships across various divisions of the company. Earlier in the month, Denel was taken to court by union Solidarity. The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria ruled that it must pay over unemployment insurance and tax deductions from staff members’ salaries. At the time Denel said it was committed to meeting its obligations to its employees. Pretoria News
