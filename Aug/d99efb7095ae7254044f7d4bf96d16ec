Pretoria - AfriForum has laid charges of money laundering and corruption against Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula at the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria. It's alleged that a supplier of sports products, Sedgars Sport, paid between R300 000 and R680 000 for the Mbalula family trip to Dubai back in 2017. AfriForum had requested the public protector to investigate the trip. The public protector found that Mbalula had violated the constitution and other legislation in this regard. She further ordered the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to launch an investigation into whether the funds used to pay for the trip had been proceeds from money laundering or not.

However, the public protector has not yet taken action and that's why AfriForum has taken a decision to lay charges. Should the state continue not to take action against the minister, AfriForum will consider applying for private prosecution to see that the matter is heard in court. The public protector found that Mbalula had visited Dubai without paying for the trip in advance and seemingly had no idea of how much it would cost. Neither Mbalula nor his family had paid for the trip. Pretoria News
