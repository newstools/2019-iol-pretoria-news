Having lost thousands in income last week during the strike by City of Pretoria workers, they found themselves having to close after a fault on a panel at the Queen Street substation plunged sections of the inner city into darkness. The power was only fully restored after 10am yesterday. Motorists crawled along the streets with traffic lights not working due to the outage. Most shops and restaurants were also closed, while others resorted to using generators. The business owners expressed their frustrations, saying they felt neglected by the City of Pretoria as nothing had been communicated to them regarding the power outage. Sidney Rammupudu, an assistant manager at Clicks on Madiba Street, said the store’s back-up power source had failed, leaving them unable to trade. TriBeCa coffee shop general manager Dawid Raaths said the outage coincided with the arrival of a generator after operating for 23 years without having any need for one. While he said it would cost him “an arm an a leg”, it had to be done to keep business going. City of Pretoria spokesperson Lindela Mashigo said only a portion of the CBD serviced by the Queen Street substation had been affected. Pretoria News
