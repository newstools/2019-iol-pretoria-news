Pupils from Sediba sa Thuto Primary School, Meetse a Bophelo Primary School, Emthunzini Primary School and Nellmapius Primary School had participated in the event in Mams Mall in Mamelodi. Each school was represented by 14 learners. In the first round all learners represented their school and competed against other schools. In the second round the number of learners from each school was cut down to three, and one for the final. Second place went to Palesa Tsotetsi from Nellmapius Primary School and third place to Tatenda Phaolosi from Emthunzini Primary School. Skhosana was elated to have won. “Competing against other learners from Mamelodi was challenging, but I eventually managed to outsmart my peers. This has made my love for mathematics grow even more than ever,” she said. Each year a different theme is chosen and the activities are offered around it, and this year it was “Facing the harsh realities of climate change”. The National Science Week seeks to contribute to share knowledge about science that is in line with the Science Engagement strategy of the Department of Science and Technology. Pretoria News
