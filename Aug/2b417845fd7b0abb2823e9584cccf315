Experts in Britain discovered that elderly participants who had never done structured exercise before still benefited from gym sessions. Surprisingly, they had the same ability to build muscle as highly trained “master athletes” of the same age. The University of Birmingham scientists compared muscle-building ability in two groups of elderly men. The first were the athletes - seven lifelong exercisers in their 70s and 80s. In the second were eight healthy individuals of a similar age, who had never tried structured exercise. Each participant drank an isotope tracer - which shows how proteins develop in muscle - before doing weight-training. Samples taken in the 48-hour periods just before and after the session showed both groups had an equal capacity to build muscle. Research leader Dr Leigh Breen said: “Our study clearly shows that it doesn’t matter if you haven’t been a regular exerciser throughout your life, you can still derive benefit from exercise whenever you start.” However, he said a “long-term commitment” to exercise was the best approach, starting later in life still helped “delay age-related frailty”.
