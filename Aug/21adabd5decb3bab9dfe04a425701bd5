The exams were written at 6 598 centres across the nation, which included schools and designated centres; the results were made available in those designated centres. Various candidates qualified to write the exam. Some were those who had been absent from the November 2018 exams, with a valid reason, as well as adult pupils with incomplete certificate requirements. “They were all qualified to write the exams. Repeating and part-time candidates enrolled for the 2018 National Senior Certificate examination, as well as those adult pupils with no previous senior credits, provided they had completed Grade9, standard seven or Adult Basic Education and Training Level 4, were also included,” the department said. It added that 6952 candidates wrote the full complement of subjects to enable them to achieve the qualification, and 700 of them attained the NSC, 186 achieved admission to bachelor studies, and 318 achieved admission to diploma studies. Candidates who are not satisfied with their results and wish to improve them may register for the November 2019 exam. Candidates may also apply for a re-check or a remark of their subject results. The closing date for the remark as well as the registration for the November exams is August16. Pretoria News
