Pretoria - Every year on September 1, the police service commemorates the men and women in blue who sacrificed and ultimately lost their lives in the execution of their duties. This year, the SAPS will be honouring 26 officers and a reservist at the SAPS memorial site, Union Buildings. The SAPS found it fitting to engrave these members’ names on the national memorial wall at the Union Buildings to signify the gratitude of the nation. The SAPS management salutes their bravery, loyalty and sacrifices to serve and protect – no longer with us, but never forgotten. Every week leading up to the day, the SAPS and Pretoria News will pay tribute to these fallen heroes and heroines as a way of saying ‘thank you, siyabonga, reya leboga, baie dankie’ for their contributions and efforts in creating a safe and secure environment for all who live in South Africa. Last year, the SAPS remembered 29 members who “selflessly chose to protect others irrespective of the fact that they risked their own lives in the process”. In his address on the day, national commissioner General Khehla Sitole also remembered the dreadful day in February 2018 when criminals entered the Engcobo police station and killed five police officials, who he said died while keeping the community of Engcobo safe.
